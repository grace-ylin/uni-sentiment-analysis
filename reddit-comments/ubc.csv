1650587568.0,Thank you to the prof who quite literally saved my life and academic career today,"My worst nightmare is being late or missing a final exam. I‚Äôve literally HAD nightmares about this. And today it happened. My phone died and none of my alarms rang and I woke up halfway through the exam and ran for my life. Never have I ever been late for an exam in my entire undergrad career.

I write with the center for accessibility and when I got there, they told me they couldn‚Äôt let me take the exam (even though there was time remaining). And then I started crying and panicking and they told me to leave (in a polite way I guess but still) and offered little to no help. I was absolutely BAWLING  my eyes out and hyperventilating walking across campus in no particular direction with people staring at me. My life was flashing before my eyes.

And then an adrenaline rush kicked in and I ran all over the campus trying to track my down my prof and found them. They were so kind and understanding and helped me calm down and made me eat something and drink water and take a walk. And then they let me write the exam in their office with my extended time and stayed there with me the entire time.

Not to be dramatic but they literally saved my life. I am super prone to panic attacks and this term has already been difficult due to suicidal ideation, and while it may seem over the top to some, I was really seriously contemplating harming myself for a moment because I felt so defeated and this was the last straw.

1649548146.0,The aftermath of yesterday's AMS party is UNACCEPTABLE.,"**THERE IS NO (TL;DR) SECTION BECAUSE THERE IS NO SHORT WAY TO SAY THIS.**

Look at this. Just take a look at this. I walked pass this absolute junkyard of a plaza this morning and posted a photo on Reddit about how this scene is the first thing visitors see on a Saturday. Y'all downvoted me, some didn't care, someone called me ""lame"", so I deleted that post. I came back this afternoon to expect it cleaned up, and I was shocked the plaza looked worse, with garbage blowing around in the wind. Take a look at these photos. Garbage, shattered bottles, condoms, food cartons. Everything.

A buddy and I got up bags and gloves and we cleaned the entire place up. Neither of us went to the party. The only other person cleaning up was the homeless guy. So thousands of you went to this party and hundreds more walked by. Yet, the only 3 people who bothered to clean up didn't even go to the party? Doesn't that seem kind of messed up?

The state of the plaza this morning is 1000% unacceptable. I want an answer, an answer from the AMS. **I'm not against parties.** I'm against not taking responsibility. I don't care if I get downvoted. I don't care. This isn't right. I'm posting this again. I'm doing this because I know this is the right thing to do. I'm not mad at y'all. I want the organizers to be less indifferent, and more responsible. I want y'all to have fun too, but next time, have fun responsibly please!

Special circumstances are not made because you had a bad day at work or because you really wanted the last piece of pineapple pizza. It is not acceptable ever, at least within Canadian society. \n\nCheating within an academic environment is 'illegal' (within the definition of university regulations) and, as evidenced by the astounding reprimand of these actions by other users on this thread, cheating is considered immoral. This is defined knowledge. The issue I am addressing is that the mindset persists that because a tough situation has arisen, the rules simply do not apply due to said situation. This is the mindset that does not bode well for the remainder of their degrees. The fact that, against all common knowledge, people decided that it was their right to cheat is the big problem.\n\nThis pandemic has been horrible for nearly every single student who attends this university, and I consider myself very lucky to have a safe place to continue my studies. I understand that most people in similar academic situations as mine are much worse off and there is immense stress, dread, and loss. However, there are official streams to go through for concerns and concessions such as professors, academic services, etc. Say what you want about their effectiveness, but official, and 'non-illegal' pathways do exist. \n\nI can guarantee a vast majority of people in horrible situations did and do not cheat, and that a large percentage of those who cheated on this midterm simply did not want to study.\n\nEmpathy is needed, absolutely, but when regarding the situations people find themselves in, not their actions. Professors need to be empathetic, the university needs to be empathetic, but we also need to understand that these individuals went out of their way, with the mindset that the rules do not apply, to cheat, regardless of their current situations.\n\nEdit: This in no way is meant to be aggressive. I just wanted to expand a bit on my previous post."", ""oh yeah no i completely understand hahahaha but it isn't too useful in upper level math courses"", ""Of course! I'm studying Civil engineering at the UBC Okanagan Campus (quick TL;DR: Easier to get in, cheaper housing, smaller classes, shittier campus, you don't have to compete for which specialization you get into but only have a limited selection). I thought I'd be into concrete, structural or something water related because that's what I was exposed to in my Engineering class in high school, but I've come around and really started enjoying transportation planning. As a specialization, I got to pick between civil, mechanical and electrical. Even though I really enjoy math, I really dislike electricity so civil was the choice for me. I like that the concepts you learn are a bit more intuitive than the other specializations. It's impossible for me to wrap my head around how electricity and circuits work, but it's plainly obvious why each step in water treatment is taken, why bus routes are planned out the way they are or why a concrete structure feels the stresses the way it does. \n\nAs for engineering as a program? Pretty tough, but rewarding. 6 classes a semester is a nightmare, so expect taking 5 classes a semester for 5 years instead. You'll be juggling a steady stream of assignments, labs and projects with midterms and finals sprinkled in, so you'll pretty much always have something due coming up. My friends and I all come from backgrounds of doing well in high school (high grades, did well in IB classes and/or AP classes) and we're all challenged by this program. Hell, all but one of the 10+ close friends I know have all failed one or more classes in university now. My lowest grades in high school were usually in the B range, but I've passed several of my classes with a 50-59% now. That all being said, I'm glad I'm here. It certainly was a blow to the gut to suddenly have to put in so much effort and only be an average student, but that only means I'm exactly where I should be. \n\nI personally have had a ton of fun with extracurriculars. If you get into engineering you should look into conferences - your engineering society will cover most of the cost and you can go have a great time while learning some interesting things. UBC Vancouver is a part of the Canadian Federation of Engineering Students (CFES) and attends their conferences, though they are the only western school that isn't a part of the Western Engineering Student Societies Team (WESST) after they decided to leave a few years ago. [Here](https://www.engsoc-ubco.com/confrences) is a quick summary of all the conferences from my engineering society. Clubs are also very popular!

I asked because I'm considering becoming an engineer. Honestly not very interested in any job whatsoever so I thought that since math is my strength I might try to become an engineer.

1611714155.0,"Today, I raised my hand in lecture for the first time in my 4 years of University","I have nobody I could tell this to in person, so enjoy it, reddit!

Today I voluntarily raised my hand and spoke out in class for the first time ever in my 4 years of University here at UBC. I have pretty crippling Social Anxiety that usually forbids me from ever raising my hand or bringing attention to myself in social situations. So, of course, up until this year I've never thought about ever participating in class lectures (yay online classes).

Today in class though, we were having a class discussion and I decided since part of my grade is speaking out in class, that I would try and raise my hand on zoom to see what would happen.

I furiously scribbled down some notes to recite out loud while I was waiting to be called on. I was *shaking* so much, I couldn't keep my hands steady while I wrote. I had to sit up straight and hold my legs down to stop myself from shaking on webcam lmao.

But I did it. I was called on, spoke for about a minute, then went back into my hole of having my mic muted and my camera off while the prof commented on what I said.

It was quite the thrill tbh (got my adrenaline pumping at least), and I cant wait to try it again soon! After all this time of not speaking up, I'm kind of sad I waited this long to try it out, but I'm glad I eventually did it. Cant wait until next class when I get to try this whole process again lol, hopefully its easier next time!

If you're gonna take anything away from this, and you're an introvert like me, just know that its never too late to start trying to speak up in class!

EDIT: Holy moly, I leave my computer for a few hours and this is what I come back to?!? Jeez now this 400 upvotes makes me feel like talking to 100 ppl today was nothing hahaha. Thank you everyone for the kind words, and I'm glad my words were able to help some of you out with your fears of speaking in class discussions :)!

However, as many have commented, it does get easier the more you do it (or at least it gets less daunting anyways with each time).

We have reviews for them and there can be upwards of 30 people in the room (precovid) + another 30 - 40 on the phone at these reviews. Whats more? My Director and VP are often present in person, as are their top brasses, up to and including the EVP and CEO (we are their clients in a multi million dollar contract). \n\nWhat I've learnt over the years to build up your courage and confidence when speaking publicly...stick to facts (add your opinion if the facts support it) and make your ask/action clear. It also helps to inject a bit of your personality to bring the human element to it. I'm still very much an introvert, but I've learnt to control the nerves a little bit better now with this framework and thru practice. And I'm sure in due time, you will too.

To me that‚Äôs bigotry just like sexism or racism, only a different flavour. \n\nAs for comparisons to insulting Trump, I can only sympathize so much there. Would different people be upset with Hackl if Trump were his target? Partly, yes. But these aren‚Äôt two random leaders of different political parties.  Trump pardoned and embraced a war criminal, separated immigrant families from their young children (by putting them in cages), famously admired repressive authoritarian regimes, and encouraged an armed revolt against his own country‚Äôs democratic transition of power.  Those are not ‚Äúconservative‚Äù actions. And they weren‚Äôt motivated by any public emergency.  They would be expected of a dictator. \n\nSo yes, there should be room and protection for criticism of Trudeau and his actions, but he and Trump are not equivalent just because they both led countries. Stepping back to the original issue, I‚Äôd say my concerns about discourse and judgement intersect. If Hackl‚Äôs biggest complaints right now are about the dangers of vaccines and the supposedly fake news of climate change, he‚Äôs not a conservative.

The scientists in the university mostly do, and I\'d bet the students are disproportionately positivists, but lots of the humanities function on all sorts of non-positivist assumptions and practices. Political science, philosophy, and practically all of the humanities are intrinsically value laden, so I don\'t really know what it means to say that the university ""deals in facts and facts alone.""

Everyone is entitled to disagree with opinions. I don\'t agree with your opinions, hence my original reply to you. Sorry if you feel attacked I guess?\n\nI think the point made flew past your head. You claim that ""everyone is entitled to their own opinion"". But you don\'t really seem to believe that, since you\'re openly trying to undermine the livelihoods of those who don\'t share your opinions. I just thought this was a humorous paradox; it\'s unsurprising you missed that since the sentence ""everyone is entitled to their own opinion"" is so idiomatic, and yet the idiom is fundamentally rooted in a defence of genuine freedom of expression. \n\n>If you\'re going to engage in a political discussion where ""freedom of speech"" is the main subject, I think it\'s important to at least understand how ""freedom of speech"" works in Canada though, right?

Morally I don\'t think it\'s wrong to fire someone for holding certain political views which don\'t align with the company they work for. Modern political issues are commonly moral issues as well.\n\nOnce again, the main point I made flew past your head. I\'ll just reiterate what I said earlier. First, political discussions aren\'t confined to ""the way things work"". The purpose of pretty much any political discussion is to shape existing policy and create new policy. It absolutely encompasses advocating for repealing or modifying particular provisions or laws which are considered unethical. Second, discussions about the ""legal system"" are a bit moot since the scope of the conversation isn\'t legal. I never implied that any conduct here is illegal nor am I offering legal advice to this individual. It\'s not even clear why the CFR is being discussed in this context. You seem to have brought it up inexplicably when it has nothing to do with the situation at hand. ""Free speech"" isn\'t principally a legal concept; it\'s also a cultural one, where private individuals and institutions are generally tolerant of the notion of amicable disagreement. The scope of this particular conversation pertains to that aspect of it.\n\nThird, notwithstanding the above remarks, there is an absurdity in trying to justify any and all censorship on the basis of freedom of speech ""having limits"" in Canada. The purpose of ""reasonable limits"" on free speech is to limit the applicability of particularly odious edge cases (blatantly hateful conduct, calls for violence, ""fire in a crowded theatre""). It\'s not somehow intended to mean that anything and everything the state or ""respectable opinion"" finds distasteful falls into the purview of those limitations. See, if you claim that ""free speech has limits"" but those limits can be basically everything that you happen to not currently like (e.g, anti-mandate protests), then that\'s not so much you thinking free speech should have limits at the boundaries than that it shouldn\'t exist at all.   \n\n>This is off topic but we do have checks and balances eh? We have an intricate system of courts, an appeals court, a Supreme Court, etc. Nobody is being arrested for criticizing JT, or protesting medical mandates.\n\nLmao, if you acknowledge that ""no one is being arrested"", that\'s in effect an acknowledgement that the matter lies outside of federal or provincial jurisdiction. So why bring up the law in the first place? You\'re the one _implying_ that since freedom of speech ""has limits"" in Canada, that this individual\'s conduct (which amounts to criticism of the ruling party of this country) should be legally reprimanded. That implication is apparent in your decision to bring up the law in the first place.', 'You know that decrease in economic output/ GDP per-capita has actual real-world consequences for people that need gov money the most?', 'different opinion lmao', ""I mean, even the truckers in Ottawa tried to have a legal proceeding through their bungled understanding of what that would look like.

Many teach this aspect as part of the organizations\' history. But yeah, there\'s a lot to unpack, many also began as at least implicitly white supremacist and still carry pieces of that. (Look up National Pahellenic *Council* Greek organizations for the other side to that story.)\n\nMost of the sororities\' operations are funded through member dues and alumni donations. Fraternities unsurprisingly bring in more from alumni donations. The fraternities\' larger spaces on campus, and their more permissive policies around social events, also allow them to host parties and events that bring in a not-insignificant amount of money.\n\nClub status sort of connects them to the AMS and allows them to, for example, book space in the Nest at student rates, promote themselves at AMS club events, etc.. There might be some modest subsidies as well, but they\'re nowhere near the bulk of campus Greek chapters\' operating budgets. The main issues with keeping or losing club status are the organizational benefits of being connected to the AMS.\n\nAn interesting side story here would be the history of Phrateres, a Greek-adjacent sorority-like organization that\'s been operating primarily as its own AMS club for decades (rather than a sorority chapter with access to a collective AMS club arm). They basically are the organization for people, primarily women, who want to participate in Greek life social events without the strictures or dues imposed by initiating into a regular sorority. Historically, they were a sorority-style organization with chapters at various universities, but their sole remaining chapter is at UBC and opted to bring itself under the auspices of the AMS and follow AMS club rules. As a result, they haven\'t been gender-exclusive for a long time. It\'s also understood that being a member of Phrateres is more fun than being a member of a sorority, but there are still hovering insulting ideas among members of sororities that being a member of Phrateres is less ""classy"" or means one is less selective about who their friends or partners are.\n\nAnyway, severing ties with their AMS club arm will not make sororities shut down, kick out all their members, or do anything to change the current use of the Panhellenic House or Fraternity Village buildings on campus. What it would do is set a precedent for the AMS about how AMS clubs are allowed to operate, and it would make it harder for sororities to use AMS Nest spaces for their events.\n\nI think there\'s a tiny sliver of merit to what this UBC Sororities advocate is saying, but it takes some explaining.\n\nSo, as I said earlier, UBC fraternities have much more money and space than UBC sororities do. Each male fraternity operating on campus has a sizable house building with lots of dorm-style rooms rented to members at a reduced rate, plus a bunch of common spaces used as lounges for residents and members most days, as meeting spaces for fraternity events, and as event space for parties and events the fraternities hold. These buildings exist in the first place because the cross-campus ""national"" fraternity organizations (unsurprisingly) have way more money than the comparable sorority organizations do. And they\'re able to subsidize their maintenance, and subsidize dues paid by current fraternity members, because ""national"" fraternity organizations have fairly permissive policies about alcohol and events, so they can make money from selling tickets to parties.\n\nSororities on campus, in contrast, don\'t have a lot of space. There\'s one apartment-style building (Panhellenic House) that has one smallish room for each sorority chapter on the ground floor, plus a small number multi-unit (think Gage/Marine Drive-style) rental units above it. This is because cross-campus ""national"" sorority organizations have less money to begin with. And also because these organizations have much more paternalistic policies about alcohol and socializing, which makes it almost impossible for sororities to host parties that would make money, even if they had spaces in which to host them.\n\nSorority chapters use these Panhellenic House lounge rooms to host weekly meetings and internal events attended by their membership, but they don\'t have enough space to host really any social events there that others can attend. To host smaller-scale external social events, like mixers with fraternity chapters (yes, that\'s a thing!) soronprities often rely on booking subsidized spaces owned by the AMS and made available to clubs. Comparable events hosted by male fraternities are usually just held in the fraternity houses themselves.\n\nSo yeah, deconstituting the club UBC sororities use to access AMS event space in the Nest *does* hit sororities harder than the same move hits fraternities, and this *does* hit harder specifically because of factors that have oppressed women historically and into the present day. Is that a good enough reason for the AMS to continue to allow the existence of a club that breaks its usual policies around gender exclusivity, and that is tied to organizations that are also problematic for a bunch of other reasons? Tbh I have no idea, but that\'s what\'s being debated right now\n\nAnd on the issue directly at hand in this article - it looks to me like the sororities see the writing on the wall and are expecting to have their AMS club arm deconstituted, so they\'re mostly negotiating the terms of their exit. The AMS probably expected deconstituting a club to usually happen when it no longer had interested members, so it would make sense to have any money in the club\'s account just rolled into a general fund that could be then used by other active clubs. They probably didn\'t expect clubs that were just small arms of other external organizations, that would be deconstituted despite those organizations\' objections.

I do understand the history is extremely racist and was basically founded for white men to lick each other‚Äôs ass holes. But when sororities started, women weren‚Äôt really allowed/encouraged to be at university and weren‚Äôt allowed to be club members. Men marginalizing the women. So they started their own.

1690998478.0,"On behalf of my UBC janitor dad, please stop being so disgusting","My dad is a janitor at UBC and he used to love it (which is still shocking, honestly). He loves the conversations he has with students and faculty alike and all of the events that happens on campus. But I think his favorite part is getting to see me on campus. He's told me his favorite days on the job are the ones where he spots me because it reminds him of what he's fighting for. It's pretty cheesy but he really does seem to enjoy working at UBC and I'm glad his experience has been pretty good.

But he's recently had the worst day ever on the job and I think it destroyed him. UBC's pretty nasty, I know, but seriously guys get your shit together. Like seriously, raw garlic and LITERAL SHIT EVERYWHERE? He's cleaned a lot of crazy things on campus but I think this one really broke his spirit. 

He doesn't leave his bedroom anymore. I tried checking up on him last night but he's completely sealed the door shut and keeps telling me to ""get out of here"" (he even sounds different, like he's growling). Whatever he saw in the study room he cleaned up two days ago was probably what made him spiral and I'm so scared for him.

I don't know if my pleas will change anything since some of you have the hygiene of a caveman, but please, guys, remember the human. Remember the people that have to clean up after you, like my dad. They're not robots that clean up your garbage, this stuff can really affect them.

You hit the parent jackpot... :)\n* Another unfortunate thing, is in the past the world didn\'t have a bunch of people who could sit back and enjoy the fruits of others labor. Royalty from all around-the- world back then, was one of those, who did enjoy the fruits of others labor, money, etc. though. I\'m guessing there\'s folks, who are thinking there  was more entitled people in-the-past, rather than what we have in modern times (Ratio). Modern folks  might be to the point, they might even crucify the whole past because they think this is so. When using population ratio, I\'m leaning towards less entitlement across-the-board historically when compared to what we see in modern times. Propaganda works... :O\n* Now some folks today have taken on that unfavorable-royalty-mindset without the royalty & money involved. Today some think other owe them, people are there to do for them, and even some are nasty when they\'re exhibiting these traits (*Entitlement knows no bounds if left unchecked).* Hopefully I\'m explaining my thoughts well enough for others to understand, grammar and finding the words to express myself is difficult for me.\n* Now this above, and natural section not being allow to do what it does very well, Has upset the balance..... :O\n* Causing situations where some people take others for granted, have no manners, and these folks barely, or ever, wear other people\'s shoes. So they to see things from all perspectives instead of only seeing world through their eyes.\n* At any given time throughout history, the world wasn\'t or isn\'t perfect. One of today\'s imperfections is entitlement across-the-board. I should\'ve have mentioned I\'\'m talking about USA concerning entitlements, but more than not, humans are humans in-the-end. Most from all around earth would  follow suite if their environments were the same.\n* Ironic when I think about the above now, most folks would say they can\'t stand the royalty of old. While at the same time, they\'re not much different when it comes to how they abuses others or don\'t wear other shoes. If they do that in today\'s environment: they\'\'d most likely been 10 times worst if they were old royalty from the past. More than not, they\'d abused those positions also, and be even worse than those we find historically. Sorta like similar to when ya wanna find out who someone is: lets see how the handle themselves in winning situation or how someone acts with power. This will tell us a bunch about individual\n* Wish I could say it\'s going to get better, but my love for math makes me think. That when I look at population #\'s alone, this new form of entitlement will be an issue in the future.. What\'s ahead isn\'t going to be pretty, no matter which way it goes. With the internet bringing everyone actions to everyone attention. Some folks will act and do what Mother Nature & Natural section would\'ve done in-the-past. The number of entitled will shrink, if humans do what humans usually do.\n* All the above is one of the reasons, I think it\'s a real possibility the true elites will cul-the-herd one day.

So, they went to the Microsoft with my Surface Pro to try to get it fixed.   \n\n\nIt must have been a slow day at the Microsoft store, but from what my friend told me, when they got there, the guy tried to blow it out with compressed air, thinking it would be full of dust, but that didn't work. He figured my friend was into computers, and took him into the back room. They weren't allowed to take any pictures, since technically customers weren't allowed back there - but from what they described, they had this special oven, as well as all sorts of tools to open the Surface Pro. (keep in mind that nobody at that time had documented a method to open that device without destroying it) The technician carefully opened it up, and inside, it turned out that the fan was entirely plugged solid with dust. Even after cleaning it, apparently, it was still running really slow. So I ended up with a new Surface, wrapped in plastic.  \n\n\nAgain, I don't know if that was made up, or if it was real. That's the story my friend told me. I mean, I'd believe it. Maybe the tech was really bored and wanted to do something different for once.  \n\n\nI did end up knowing someone that worked at the Microsoft store years later. Whenever I'd go to the store we would talk for quite a while and the management was okay with it since there weren't any other customers at the time and after all, I was technically a customer and they were told to talk to customers for as long as they wanted. I always got a free drink every time I went, and it was  one of those Starbucks Frappucino bottles too.   \n\n\nI miss the Microsoft store, honestly. They had some good vibes going on in there. There were always the kids on the Xboxes playing Fortnite, the employees were all really knowledgeable and passionate - you could tell they loved being there and loved talking to customers about all the latest devices. They sold computers without all the manufacturer garbageware preloaded, and they had a nice extended warranty service that a friend went and got a computer fixed 7 times for (last time around they just exchanged it for a brand new Surface!)."", 'When this incident happened I did visit the microsoft store (2019), but they just rejected my claim saying that the keyboard is not part of the device.

1630900914.0,Anyone who went to the frat parties: you likely have COVID.,"My friends all stupidly and selfishly attended the frat parties on Tuesday and Wednesday, with upwards of 200-400 people. They just got tested after three days of coughing, and surprise, they tested positive. All 3 of them are double vaccinated and thought it wouldn't be an issue - a stupid mistake on their part.

They've been to Save-On, Sharetea, other areas on campus and Wesbrook village and are now quarantining. I am extremely worried as this means that more than likely, everyone at these frat parties have been exposed to COVID and likely have it.

My friend also disclosed to me that many of the guys at the frats have been tested and are choosing to keep their diagnosis secret so they can attend Imagine UBC and the rest of their courses.

Their professors are not allowing them to have online accommodations, forcing them to either miss important coursework or come to class with COVID.

And given the amount of attention fraternities get on this subreddit, you can put money down that such a notice being issued would be front page on the Ubyssey and CBC News the moment it went online. \n\nSo, to do my due diligence, I called 8-1-1, to figure out if I needed to get tested for the virus, and the response that I got from that phone call was that, to the best of their knowledge, this remains an \'unsubstantiated rumor\', and that there hasn\'t been an uptick in the case positivity rate, or a jump in cases per 100,000 in VCH one would anticipate with the scale of exposure.  There\'s still time for that to change given the incubation period and possibility of asymptomatic transmission, but there are also factors that make this claim less plausible: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The immunization rate of UBC\'s permanent population is 92%, and *all* international students are either fully vaccinated, or had to undergo a mandatory quarantine. All the data we have available points to the fact that two doses of vaccines are effective at reducing transmission, and *extremely* effective at reducing severe cases of COVID-19. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*  There\'s *zero* evidence that the vaccination rate among fraternity members of Greek Life is lower than average.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* To the best of my knowledge, Fraternities have been requiring outside guests to show proof of vaccination + a valid postsecondary identification for entry. Even if you think fraternity men are all dumbfuck alcoholics, they have to live in communal living space, and it would *suck* for all of them to have COVID-19 outbreak in their house.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Fraternities have been part of a rapid testing pilot because of the communal living situation since October, 2020, because their housing environment is at elevated risk for transmission (even at half-capacity). There\'s been *constant* communication between fraternity leadership and the university during the entire  course of pandemic, just as there is with the University Neighborhoods Association, affiliate colleges, staff, faculty etc.  Y\'all are trippin\' if you think otherwise. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* UBC has a very low cases per 100,000 rate, and there hasn\'t been an uptick in case positivity since numbers were last updated on September 4th. Assuming the hearsay claim about persons ""keeping positive test results \'secret\' to Imagine Day and classes"" is true: \n\n1. The Vaccine Passport is taking effect soon. Anyone unvaccinated that *would* be at risk would not be able to participate in I-Day without a negative PCR test, and would be unable to enter most high-traffic areas on campus, reducing the risk of transmission. \n2. The Mask PHO for indoor spaces reduces the risk of transmission further.\n3. Most of those indoor spaces have upgraded ventiliation and air filtration systems, reducing the risk of transmission further. \n4. A \'herd-immunity\' level of people who frequent campus are fully vaccinated, this signficantly reduces transmission, and means even \'breakthrough\' infections are *very very likely* to be mild, if not entirely asymptomatic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe amount of fearmongering going on here is seriously disturbing.', ""Not accusing OP of lying here and the UBC community should absolutely exercise caution but it's very easy to fear monger situations like this especially considering how unpopular the frat parties already are"", 'Is this a rumour?', 'Yea this sounds like a lie\n\nYou mean to tell me your friends got a rapid covid test, tested positive and the school never found out?

The big draw of JumpStart parties has always been first years and international students; many of whom do not know how to hold their liquor, who take drinks from strangers, who try substances for the first time without testing them. There's generally such a huge crowd there that any kind of sudden panic would provoke a stampede that would probably hurt tens, if not hundreds of partygoers. A few years back, when Fraternity leadership had their heads out of their asses, there was a push to permanently end the practice of open parties, and it's distressing to me as an older Greek that they've made a return. At this point, I've gotten pretty much everything I can out of the Greek System, so if it faded away at UBC, I wouldn't attend its funeral.\n\nIf this post was being made in September, 2020; when the Alpha Variant was circulating, when nobody was vaccinated against COVID-19, when hospitalizations were straining critical care capacity and surgeries were being cancelled, the OP would absolutely have a point. At that point in the pandemic, a gathering like this *would have* provoked a large volume of cases. It's why the argument for a year of Zoom University was credible from a public health point of view.  **We're not in September, 2020, we're at a different point in our management of this pandemic.** \n\nMy fundamental point is that the vaccines work. All the data says that the vaccines work*.* It is \\~60-70% effective at preventing transmission of COVID-19 if you're fully vaccinated, six months on from your second dose. It's 99% effective at preventing severe cases of COVID: if you've taken a vaccine approved for use by Health Canada, you're as likely to end up in the hospital with seasonal influenza this fall as you are with COVID. The vaccine also cuts down the duration of time a 'breakthrough' infection can transmit the virus, from 10-21 days when you're unvaccinated, to 2-3 days when you're vaccinated. \n\nNow *on top* of the effective and durable provided by vaccination, other layers of protection have been put in place to *further* reduce risk. We know this virus transmits indoors, especially with poor ventilation. Surprise, most of the ventilation systems at UBC have been upgraded. To further reduce the rate of transmission, the PHO mask mandate was reintroduced, though personally I think it should be strengthened to a *medical grade* mandate, because Becky and Bethany's Aritzia cloth mask isn't protecting anyone from anything. \n\nAnd that's not even getting into the quarantine measures for international students, the mandatory vaccinations to live on residences, requirements for daily rapid testing for those who haven't gotten vaccinated, and the opening of an operational rapid testing clinic on campus for our health and safety. \n\nAlso, if you think these idiots that came out in their hundreds to the frats are somehow going to avoid congregating in large groups in their residences, their cabins in   Whistler, and re-opening nightclubs, I've got a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you. \n\nThis original post combines the three things I hate the most about this subreddit during the COVID-19 pandemic: hysteria about the virus disconnected from any evidence and data, the relaying of hearsay information as if it were proven fact, and the willingness to dismiss what someone is saying because of how this subreddit percieves Greeks. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis may very well cause a spike in cases, it would contradict all the freely available provincial data we have about the rate of breakthrough infection, the efficacy of vaccines at preventing transmission, and the window in which breakthrough infections can transmit. \n\nand guess what? If 92% of the permanent population of UBC is fully vaccinated, and the other 8% (and shrinking!) are getting daily rapid testing, with a mask mandate in place, the *risk* of a COVID surge that will send us all back online is *very very low.*"", ""Not when they're spreading covid...."", 'Exactly!

The prof couldn't prove that they didn't so they were allowed to keep writing, albeit under a more watchful eye. Not 10 mins later, the same student brought to the front again. Turns out they also hid a cheat sheet under a literal pyramid of pencils and erasers. The student got kicked out of the room this time. But it gets better a few mins later.

Emotionally, high-TIV individuals were more likely to experience feelings of hurt more intensely, and for longer periods of time (Studies 2A and 4), and recall negative emotions more easily (Study 3).

Share!', 'I wanted to let you know I do not think teaching indigenous history is worthless, and I absolutely would not think she is representative of all indigenous individuals. I have a feeling that many would think the same, but are just not participating as much in the comments. Even on ""this side"" (for lack of a better word), the more extreme comments tend to be the loudest unfortunately.\n\nI have been following what\'s going on since the very first post about the original incident about a week ago. I tried my best to be critical about what I read (i.e. Not automatically accepting or rejecting Dr Wolf\'s statements nor reddit comments from supposed (ex) students) and letting the evidence lead me to a conclusion rather than the other way around. Often there is truth to both sides and I suspect it could be the case for this. But then, it felt wrong seeing facebook posts and tweets about the first media attention on the situation: the Ubyssey article. A small group of people immediately shared posts, retweeted and demanded pitchforks be raised. Even if your understanding of the situation is based soley on the Ubyssey article, how did it go from Dr Wolf\'s view that her students exhibited ""at worst... the possibility of unconscious and unacceptable biases, the reinforcement of white supremacy and/or Indigenous specific racism and misogyny"" to everyone sharing ""facts"" about UBC protecting white misogynist supremacists men and white mothers complaining on behalf their sons? \n\nWhy are people so fixated about these students being adults and that one parent wrote a letter? How good is this letter and can we have the same person write letters for us since apparently UBC never cares about student opinions except when it is from this parent. I realize the optics of having a parent ""fight your battle"" is not good, but we don\'t actually know who made the complaint. You can enroll in the teacher program after a first degree and some work/volunteer hours. So it\'s likely that at least some TCs are under 25 years old. We know brains don\'t fully develop until people are 25, and in BC, people can stay on their parents health insurance until they are 24. I am not suggesting that 24 year olds are not adults but if they  are young enough to have a parent provide insurance for them, perhaps we can give them a little slack and not mock them about needing help from a parent too in this case? Maybe we don\'t make it sound like someone with a brain that might not even be fully matured yet is irredeemable and should be permanently marked as lost causes for the world to see. The fact that someone\'s parent made a fuss is a recurring talking point I\'ve seen for why these students must be entitled racists who do not deserve the opportunity to learn how to be a teacher. Also, has anyone ever considered that perhaps people actually do not have physical control over their parent\'s actions, even if they are full grown adults? \n\nI saw many use white supremacy as a very broad and general term, instead of its dictionary meaning. I can understand the reason behind this. I\'ve seen the argument that we should learn to be comfortable pointing out and accepting ""white supremacy"", instead of it being a label that evokes anger and defensiveness. The fact is yes, all of us are benefitting from it, even those who are BIPOC such as myself. After all, how can we make changes to our biases and attitudes if we can\'t even acknowledge the existence of it. That\'s what we\'d want ideally. But in reality, as it stands right now, the term ""white supremacy"" currently only holds one meaning to most in the general public. Does anyone actually believe that when an employer sees the term ""white supremacy"" in a person\'s file, they will correctly understand all the nuances and its intended meaning behind it? It\'s fine to start the change but right now when we use this term on official record, we are not allowing anyone to learn and grow from it. I also find it alarming that many people who are using white supremacy in this expanded definition are also the ones who are spreading posts and comments about  UBC protecting white students who are also actual white supremacists. They tell people its important to check our attitudes and our privilege so we can learn how to change, but when it comes to these TCs, they do not deserve that chance. What specific actions make these students so horrible that they won\'t allow them a chance to learn from their mistakes while demanding at the same time for other people to accept new broader definitions of white supremacy without being offended because its the only way to move towards real change? \n\nIs it a coincidence that only after Dr Wolf doxxed her students, are a lot of people starting to publicly ask questions about what happened? Aside from the initial post on reddit, almost every mention of this situation involved people using their own experience with racism as evidence the proves Dr Wolfs assessment of the students as white supremacists in every sense of the word, or involved retweeting/sharing the same ""facts"" with no followup or deeper dive into what happened. Even if I completely accept that all 12 students were literally white supremacists, I would still want to know more. Were they sharing Nazi propaganda? Did they straight up say it? Or was it in more subtle ways? Was it a miscommunication? I want to know because information is important, and it helps me know what we should do next. Should I demand UBC kick these students out? Or if UBC is producing so many racists exhibiting subtle racist behaviours, perhaps a new curriculum is needed? Should we demand more lessons on communication? Asking questions is not meant to convey a dismissal of Dr Wolf\'s experience but to her supporters, it is a grave sin. \n\nI\'m sure for many people, since Dr Wolf has now done something clearly inappropriate and wrong, it gave them ""permission"" to comment without fearing those inevitable accusations (it\'s pretty hard to argue that believing doxxing is wrong is due to racism). Ultimately I think people (myself included) are just more comfortable expressing what we had been thinking already but didn\'t want to risk bringing down the mob on us . Unfortunately it includes people who already think indigenous history is useless and only needed an excuse to reinforce their beliefs.\n\nI question myself if I would feel this way if Dr Wolf wasn\'t of indigenous ancestry. I\'m pretty sure it\'s a yes. Ive seen people say ""always listen, never ignore"" rather than ""always believe never question"", and I agree with that in general. It\'s hard to see what is wrong about that, but how can I even know that I am not exhibiting unconscious biases and perpetuating white supremacy. I\'m simultaneously sure I have been completely honest with myself but at the same time unsure if I feel that way because I am completely oblivious. After all, oblivious people never know they are oblivious. \n\nAnyway, I apologize for this being so long. If you read all of it, thank you for your time. Other than the first paragraph, the rest are not directed at you.

I wanted to explain my thought process about why I would usually stay away from these types of discussions, and to remind people that the loudest voices are usually the most extreme and often unsavory. But in the process this turned into an examination of why I am so frustrated by Dr Wolfs ardent supporters. So much so that this is clearly more a rant to the world about them than anything else.

And of course we have work to do to learn, and you are right racism comes in many ways so these 12 don‚Äôt have to be ‚Äòfull blown white supremacists‚Äô to be scratched from teaching indigenous content.

1. Breasts is actually a gender neutral term, as we all have them. Both sex's can indeed get breast cancer. The dictionary's definition ""**Glandular organ located on the chest of a human"".**
2. Can anyone even point to if there has ever been a pregnant trans man who has ever attended UBC?
3. The school spent actual money on this

The problem is that he suggested that those facts may be because of genetics which is absolute bogus and extremely unscientific.

IQ tests aren‚Äôt all they claim to be (a completely objective and universal measure of intelligence), which is a well-known fact in the social sciences. \n\nSounds like a serious error in judgment for him to even bring this subject up given how little he seems to know about it.

Seems racist.\n\nAlso if he knew anything about intelligence testing or the concept of intelligence ( there are many kinds), he would realize the results are inconclusive and certainly not just based on genetics.   Ergo he‚Äôs an uninformed racist.', 'Where would these statistics come from? Black people in America had most of their culture erased and are still yet trying to figure it out. Most weren‚Äôt allowed in schools or were out in different ones that weren‚Äôt as good. Of course white people would score better because of the resources they were given.. yet this prof was trying to say that white people are smarter than black people NATURALLY, and added the ‚Äúasians are smarter than whites‚Äù to not sound racist. It didn‚Äôt work. IQ tests have been proven to not be accurate anyways so him mentioning this was genuinely so unnecessary and wrong. \nYou are more likely to score better on an IQ test when you were given the privilege of a proper education, OBVIOUSLY historically that wouldn‚Äôt play in favour of POC. This is ridiculous.\n\n\nThank you for sharing the transcript', 'This is a common argument made by racists and it\'s one that\'s pretty easily debunked by looking at the fallibility of IQ testing itself.\n\nFor starters, \'IQ\' (intelligence quotient) isn\'t an objective thing that exists for each person, it\'s a quotient of a bunch of test scores that calculate ""mental age"" by actual age to determine how smart you are relative to other people your age. That concept of mental age is very vague, and in the past IQ testing involved questions on common sense that were based on white American cultural notions and norms. This is why when black Americans were tested they often scored lower, because their cultural references were different from their white counterparts. This is also why Asian people scored lower on IQ tests decades ago for the same reason.\n\nEven as they\'ve updated the test to try to make it more objective and less racially biased, there are still other factors that contribute to differences in IQ testing. For instance, people in West Asian countries tend to score higher on modern IQ tests because those tests are based on more reasoning - spatial, mathematical and logical - which are part of curricula in those countries, whereas they are less explicit in North American or even many European countries\' curricula. African countries tend to have lower average scores as well, in due part because many of them do not have universal education to begin with. (It should be noted that in many countries this is due to financial restructuring in the 80s and 90s which was pushed on African countries by the IMF, World Bank and many Western countries, part of which involved dismantling public education.) In that sense, IQ testing is less a measure of any objective intelligence that exists within a person and is more a combination of an individuals reasoning skills and whether or not they had an education that nurtured and tested those skills.\n\nFor a professor to go off about race and IQ in a chemistry class makes little sense - he is not an expert on intelligence testing or cognitive ability and it sounds like it was completely irrelevant to the class he was teaching. Maybe he didn\'t think he was being racist, but he bought in to racist arguments surrounding innate cognition and intelligence without bothering to do his due reading or figure out if anything he was learning was actually true. For that, he is somewhat ironically responsible for his lack of intelligence in that regard and is definitely responsible for his poor decision to bark off racist rhetoric during an entirely unrelated lecture.', ""I see nothing wrong with this if he has the stats to back it up.

I‚Äôll post it here.\n\n> A Case Study in Bad Faith IQ Arguments\n\n>I\'ve had a number of students email me about an apparent recent incident in which a UBC professor made a comment about IQ and race during their class, and is now being investigated. I am not aware of the details beyond what students have shared with me, but given that we just spent a whole week on this topic, I wanted to share a quick thought on the situation in the abstract. I do not want to comment about this specific individual and specific instance of what was or wasn\'t said, but instead comment on a more general tendency that comes up quite often in public and private when folks start talking about race and IQ.\n\n>Keep in mind, I\'m speaking about this both from the perspective of a psychologist informed about the data and its interpretation, and as an individual who is deeply concerned about implicit racism that is justified as ""scientific fact"". The former point I think you can take as a matter of expertise and me communicating it as your instructor and reiterating what we have learned in lecture, the latter as more of a matter of professional opinion and me communicating it to you as a human being.\n\n>(1) As we outlined in the lecture, there have been several studies documenting higher IQ scores on standardized IQ scores for Asian Americans compared to Caucasian Americans, and in turn higher scores for Caucasian compared to Black Americans. But psychologists also remind everybody that these differences mean very little in terms of any kind of inherent, fixed, or genetic determinism. There are extreme differences - in Canada, America, and elsewhere - in terms of educational opportunities, test expectations, test practice, test anxiety, stereotype threat, etc. that are plausible explanations and often confirmed explanation for this data. Indeed, if you tell the same group of people (say, Black Americans) that the same test is a measure of ""intelligence"" versus ""perception"" they do differently, with lower scores on the former and higher on the latter (we will learn even more about this later in the term). Clearly, then, intelligence tests are measures of more than just intelligence.\n\n>(2) You will hear many people say ""race differences in IQ are fact, and facts are not racist"". Sometimes you will even hear people say ""I\'m not saying they are genetic; I\'m saying they could be/are environmental, and therefore I am not being racist"" (as if only claims about genes and IQ could be racist!). But here\'s the thing: if you spend any time understanding how communication works, you quickly learn that communication is never just an act of conveying facts for no reason. We all communicate with intent to create thoughts in other people\'s minds, in a context, in a rich history informed by our individual and cultural histories. This is why, for example, hate symbols are hate symbols; there is nothing inherently hateful about a green cartoon frog, but it acquires a meaning in its intent and history of usage.\n\n>So, in the future, when you hear folks tell you that they are just saying facts about IQ and race, I would strongly advise you to consider: why are these facts being communicated? In what context are they being shared? What is included vs. left out when one shares them? After all, one can say racist things without directly being racist. And because the long sociocultural history of this data has been repeatedly to reaffirm genetic essentialism and/or eugenics (even The Bell Curve tried this option, saying that they are not saying that genes cause intelligence, while simultaneously insisting that welfare should be cut off to promote higher adaption within our cultures; huh?). So an individual merely sharing data points is, in my experience, usually acting in bad faith. They have a story they are trying to tell in the background, and if they do not clearly state what is in the background in the foreground, they are hiding their true intent.\n\n>You might say ""but we don\'t know the individual\'s true intent, and we should give them the benefit of the doubt"". But consider: an individual blindly sharing such facts is either doing it for the intent we are attributing to them, or they are doing it as an act of blind ignorance about the cultural history of these data points. And if they are not taking the time to educate themselves about that history, what are they doing sharing this data in the first place? It is almost impossible to spend any time with data on race and IQ and not also find reservations and limitations of such data, and information about the long history of how these facts have been used to discriminate against or outright kill or sterilize individuals that were perceived as low IQ, in Canada as well as elsewhere (again, please check out https://eugenicsarchive.ca/discover/timeline). \n\n>So, at best, sharing these ""facts"" without context is irresponsible, especially from people who are trusted to be experts in position of power.\n\n>How could a person do justice to bringing up such facts? Many ways, but here is one suggestion. Note them in a relevant context for a clear reason, then immediately share the broader history of how these facts have been interpreted - traditionally and today. After all, it\'s as much a fact that these data have been used to prop up deeply racist, harmful, and systemic acts against other human beings as anything else. Plenty of citations can be included to support this. Then noting that the modern interpretation of such facts by psychologists who are experts in the field is as evidence of social problems that we should collectively try to fix. Anything short of this - any ""just saying"" - is, in my opinion, an irresponsible cop-out.\n\nI don‚Äôt agree with his argument about Pepe the frog being a hate symbol, but I think he brings up some other points that do make sense.', 'Honestly, it was pretty messy.

I don\'t think it would be overstating things to say that across the last 150 years of leadership in ALL Western countries, the leaders who ended up NOT being racist is a small handful. So clearly racist people can end up being in very powerful positions, whether or not they are ""smart"". And clearly they also have enough social awareness to end up being in the top positions of power. Given that, is it really unbelievable to you that racist people and racist groups can have political tactics that spill over into online recruitment? \n\nThere is a growing movement of alt-right, white nationalist, far right, fascist‚Äì whatever you want to call it‚Äì people and groups coming to power right now in many Western countries.

I highly encourage you to watch the video I posted in my original comment, it\'s very relevant to this discussion.\n\nAs to your final questions...if you\'re in a Neo-Nazi organization, it\'s actually *very beneficial* to you to grow your numbers through recruitment. Getting more people fighting for your cause is beneficial to almost any group. So there are very clear and obvious benefits to these tactics. You might not realize it, but if you spend any amount of time on the Internet you\'ve probably run across some sort of social campaign that was actually organized online by 4chan or 8chan, many of whom would describe *themselves* as alt-right. Tt used to be way more common from 2015-2019 or so. If you ever heard about people posting up signs that said ""It\'s Okay to Be White"" and then people arguing about it, or heard about controversy over people saying that the ""OK"" hand sign signaled white supremacy, or the glass of milk emoji, or came across a particularly ""cringey"" internet personality going viral over their insane ""ultra-woke"" takes, then it\'s likely that you came across an organized campaign that originated on 4chan, specifically designed to make so-called ""normies"" think that people correctly identifying the alt-right tactic look crazy. If I know nothing about the situation, and I see people getting angry over an ""It\'s Okay to be White"" sign, maybe I\'m going to ask myself ""Well...I mean it is okay to be white, right? It\'s okay to be any race. And people are calling these signs racist??? Everyone is so sensitive these days, maybe the people saying our culture is getting too PC have a point"". And that thought process right there was the **entire point** of a worldwide campaign organized on 4chan to post ""It\'s Okay to be White"" posters everywhere. I even saw some on campus, and that exact same conversation happened on this very subreddit.\n\nSo in conclusion, of course racist people are smart enough to have tactics.

Wealthier, healthier, and generally more educated proportions of the population will perform better on IQ tests. \n\nAlso, I would note that IQ scores can vary immensely over a short period of time. For example, the case of the Irish and the Chinese (based on IQ tests done of Shanghai children in the late 1970's vs. more recently showing an increase of almost 10 to 15 average IQ points between the periods) shows how much even factors such as nutritional profiles in diets and overall health can influence IQ scores (starving Irish peasants and Chinese farmers probably weren't producing too many children that scored in the genius category of the IQ range).\n\nRegarding the BIPOC lack of perspective, this has more to do with certain nuances in many IQ tests being designed to favor Euro-centric linguistic and notational understandings, particularly those relating to language (Many early IQ studies from which the racial IQ gap between African blacks and whites were done conducted among rural, semi-educated blacks using exams which clearly discriminated against them based on their educational status). More recent IQ tests have tended to be more reasonable in this regard, and thus there have been observed decreases in the IQ gap in more appropriately designed IQ tests.\n\nFurthermore, you can learn more about some of the immense fuckery and bullshit that goes on with data relating to IQ testing and race in this (very long) video regarding the IQ Bell Curve:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBc7qBS1Ujo&ab\\_channel=Shaun\n\nIn summary, socioeconomic conditions, general dietary nutrition and physical health, and access to education (of the kind that helps with IQ tests such as the heavily testing-focused type found in East Asian countries) is statistically much better at predicting IQ scores than the racial association of an individual.

The professor brings to the university what they want to teach to the students, all of the topics, lessons, everything.  The university then decides who they want to hire based on what the professor will be saying.  Do you see the issue with this?  In subjects that dont have a standard system (like STEM fields) these topics can be wildly subjective to professors personal opinion, and is not vetted by any science, studies or even other professors.  This makes for a very very easy place to instill a system of indoctrination.  Which has already been done.\n\nMany many many professors throughout north america are teaching subjects they dont have any authority to be teaching. Young and impressionable students, who paid 10\'s of thousands to listen to them, will generally assume what is being taught is correct because they paid significant money to listen to it.  Sorry to say, its simply not true anymore.

I was accused of being a colonizer, but my heritage has no colonization history.  Lumping all white people into one group is a form of bigotry and sometime racist (depending on situation) that almost all white are subjected to daily, but usually dont take notice to it.\n\nTheres thousands more examples.  I know you were taught that racism has to do with power structures, but it doesnt.  Racism is within a person, a racist power structure is placed by powerful people that happen to be racists.  The racism needs to exist first before a racial structure can be created and implemented.  Therefore, systemic racism is an OUTCOME of racism, it is NOT the definition of racism.', 'Oh no :( . Sammis was excellent and I did so much better than 203 in that class. Hope it gets better for you!', 'Firstly, straw-manning the argument about the importance of socioeconomic conditions as being ""their parents were all banking billionaires"" is rather disingenuous. The point of bringing up these (largely) environmental factors behind predicting IQ scores is to understand that there is a fundamentally significant amount of pre-selection which differentiates a high IQ person from a lower IQ person that is unrelated to the intrinsic biological (genetic in particular) characteristics of an individual.\n\nRegarding your question about athletics and genetics, I am going to pre-emptively assume that your purpose behind the question is to say that well-observed genetic contributions and variance in population-specific (using the word race really doesn\'t make sense since immense variation exists within supposed races, especially Africans whose genetic diversity is greater in even small portions of the continent than that observed among all Eurasian populations) athletics performance and associated characteristics (for example, the proportion of fast and slow-twitch muscle fibers) map proportionally to explain brain differences and, by consequence, IQ differences between populations. \n\nMy first point of response here would be to **actually acknowledge that you would  be correct to say (if you did) that genetic differences DO exist regarding brain function and the associated cognitive capacity between various genetic clusters and the clines** (the fancy and more accurate term for geographically-specific groups of population clusters, i.e. what may be called races if we are being charitable). There are in-fact over 150 genes in particular that have been shown to impact brain development and function. It would not be surprising if many of these genes then also directly impact IQ scores and cognitive function (making the relatively reasonable assumption that these two are linked). The question of heritability is an obviously contentious one, but we can assume that most of these genes are heritable and thus can vary in their proportion / activity in different clusters of human populations. The short and simple version is that genetic differences must exist between human populations regarding intelligence.\n\n**My key point of contention and issue for debate would be the proportional effect of genetics vs. environment is not equal.** I have several reasons to argue that environment is much better able to explain these differences in IQ / cognitive ability than genetics. Among these, I would point to phenomena such as epigenetics (the relatively small-time scale impacts of environment on certain genes) and how genetic expression with regards to the heritability of specific genes is more impacted by environment than would be assumed otherwise. \n\nRegarding epigenetics, the expression of genes is able to be controlled by environmental conditions. The topic itself is beyond the scope of a reddit post, but in summary you could say that when environmental conditions are ideal or particularly unideal, the expression of many genes can be impacted, especially during the course of childhood and pre-adolescent development.\n\nGoing back to the question of athletic performance, a similar analogy would be if someone had great genes for long-marathon running but not so great for short-distance sprinting (such as a person from a population near the Horn of Africa). Ultimately, that genetic potential for better or worse performance in different contexts will be influenced by genetics, but the genes themselves are not absolutely independent of environmental factors. A person with a bad diet which prevents the adequate development, particularly in youth, of the muscle-tissue which genetics may otherwise have provided, will be hindered. This can go beyond just the inherent development of muscle tissue to the level where the genes are not even expressed to begin with, which impacts then the degree of heritability for the unexpressed genes in the offspring of this person. It\'s a very complex interaction between genetic heritability, gene expression, and the environmental conditions which can favor or inhibit these two aspects of genetics.\n\nLook, the most general summary of the notionally anti-racist position on race and IQ can be summed as such:\n\n**There are observable differences in average racial IQ\'s due to genetics. The degree of impact due to environmental conditions alone is greater than the impact of genetics alone on intelligence. The impact of environmental conditions on the expression and heritability of genes (in general and thus also for those pertaining to cognitive function) is significant (i.e. epigenetic significance). Hence, environmental factors explain (statistically predict) IQ variance to greater extent than belonging to a genetic cluster or cline (racial classification).**\n\nThis normative claim of IQ differences due in part to genetics   \ndoes not justify racial discrimination , but rather the prescriptive solution of attempting to find ways to improve the environmental conditions which contribute to these differences to ensure the cognitive, mental, and physical well-being of all humans. If differences still continue to persist when environmental conditions are made ideal, then we can have a talk about maybe trying to help optimize or adjust people with varying genetically-caused cognitive capacities towards life paths that provide them with greatest liberty, well-being, and fulfillment possible. Until such a situation arises, the focus of most academic efforts at investigating this phenomenon should be to identify how to overcome the environmental dimension behind IQ differences in different human populations. \n\nNow I must sleep.

The CEO is pretty rude in real life...but from what I've seen, he only attacks people who he thinks are making false claims.

If Mike was able to access personal info from his computer (i.e. names, student IDs, etc.), then yes, there was a breach. We should all sue (especially you).

If you study, you\'ll do okay but in ur science psyc classes your gonna have to study a lot more to get the same grades as peers in BIOL or ISCI. Personally, most of my classmates and I have found the arts psych classes to be easy to grasp and \\~usually\\~ end up being on the good side of the curve, it\'s all really about just eventually getting a study method that just ""clicks"" for these classes. In the end, I def think choosing BNS is worth it because psych classes (be it arts or science) are just SO interesting and applicable to real life (might be worth considering if you find urself dosing off learning about bugs) and the major is quite niche, good sense of community bc we aren\'t too big/small as a major, and LOTS of research opportunities, if that\'s something you\'d like to explore. \n\nBtw please dont feel discouraged choosing the major just cuz of scaling, most profs are pretty good about it, if you do enough research when choosing profs you will be quite safe, might even end up being scaled up in some classes (profs make the classes hard on purpose so they don\'t have to scale people down and can actually scale up instead). Only once ever I\'ve been scaled down and this was for a required course where I could not choose my prof. \n\nAlso, the elective space in 3rd/4th year is literally INFINITE, so there\'s lots of chance to make up for potentially dip in grades from a tough second year as well as for exploring your interests! Also the few required courses that we do have in upper year feel like electives themselves and are just SO interesting. (Many other majors who are interested in psyc take these ""required"" courses of our as fun electives anyway, which speaks of the difficulty of our program compared to other science majors). \n\nPersonally, I really liked BNS cuz everything is all laid out for me from the start of my degree and I just have to take all the classes, and then take whatever electives I like nearing graduation. Whereas for something like ISCI you have to put in a bunch of effort creating your degree proposal/finding a prof to mentor you/having to rearrange your entire proposal/argue why each class you take is relevant to your degree whenever you end up taking a different class than what you have planned.', ""I agree with pretty much everything u/scubadivingg said, but just want to give a different take on this, as a former BNS student (my current flair probably gives away my bias, but I‚Äôll try to be objective here):\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking to pick BNS because you‚Äôre genuinely interested in the science behind psychology, or for the pre-med route, by all means go for it. However, if you‚Äôre unsure about what you want out of psyc/life-science, I‚Äôd caution picking BNS over other majors. I think that to make the most of BNS, you really need to have a plan/goal going into it. Scuba is right about the electives leaving room for exploring interests. But there are certain things about the BNS curriculum that (imo) make it a poor choice if you‚Äôre the average life-sci student who‚Äôs ‚Äú*maybe pre-med but not sure and doesn‚Äôt really have a firm goal of working in research*,‚Äù and is interested in BNS just because neuro/brain science sounds cool (not hating, this was me once upon a time).  \n\nEmployability and skillsets aren't always something students really consider when picking majors. Across the different science majors, you can kinda break down the unique skills you can gain into: Domain Knowledge, Wet-Lab (working inside the lab with cells/animals/chemicals, etc) skills, and Dry-Lab (i.e. analytical) skills. Like most life-science majors, the core undergrad courses in BNS mainly consist of learning about concepts/theories related to your field. But BNS in particular pretty much goes all in on domain knowledge - unlike other life-sci majors, there are no actual labs you take that help you acquire wet-lab skills (beyond the pre-req chem labs common to all life-sci). And unlike other non life-sci majors, you don‚Äôt take many math/stats courses, so you don‚Äôt develop very strong analytical skills.\n\nSecondly, unlike other life-sci majors, the domain knowledge you acquire in BNS is applicable to a narrower range of fields. This is great if BNS is your jam (the faculty is excellent and leading in this field!). It‚Äôs not so great if you‚Äôre not sure about BNS and want flexibility. The hodgepodge of info you learn in other majors would be more widely applicable across diverse fields of research, and even BNS itself. \n\nThe program does help match you with a lab, and many go on to continue working in these labs. This is, imo, the strongest aspect of the program (research opportunity), and it can definitely bring your skillset up to be on par with (and possibly even exceeding) those of other majors. But what you end up doing, learning, and getting out of this is heavily dependent on you (need to find a proper fit for a lab, commit to volunteering, take on more projects, etc).\n\nAs a result, if you don‚Äôt engage deeply with a lab, or don‚Äôt make proper use of your electives, the base skill set and knowledge you come out with is largely limited to BNS domain knowledge and the pre-req course knowledge common to all life-sci students. It‚Äôs applicable to real-life in the sense that you can make sense about certain phenomena (e.g. what‚Äôs actually triggering my hunger in my brain? How does my brain form memories?). But not so applicable when it comes time to finding a job outside of academia or in industry (not including non-science jobs here, which puts most life-sci students at a pretty much even playing field, but that‚Äôs another issue entirely).\n\nIf you compare this with say, the base skill set a biochem major might be required to have, (more hands-on lab experience/widely applicable domain knowledge), I‚Äôd argue that students from BNS are at a less prepared and less flexible position at the outset (unless they take steps to remedy this with volunteering/electives). I rarely see BNS students in non-psych labs (except for maybe clinical positions). Whereas in contrast, I‚Äôve seen many non-BNS students who are easily able to work in BNS labs. Of course, this is only anecdotal, and I‚Äôm aware there is a bias there, since BNS students are more likely to go to these labs in the first place, but it‚Äôs worth noting\n\nIf you‚Äôre interested in studying the brain, make sure you have a reason for picking BNS over another major. A good scenario to ponder is this: Let‚Äôs say I make a rat run in a maze everyday, and I record its daily runtime. Do you care more about how the performance of the rat improves? How inducing similar changes in the brain can cause improvements or worsening of the learning/memory of the rat? And how this can be extrapolated to learning/memory in other situations or neurological disorders? **Or**, are you more interested in how the neurons in the brain are actually growing to form connections for the learning process? How the underlying mechanism for the memory/learning process actually occurs on a biological/cellular level, and how that changes the brain? This is a generalization, but if you‚Äôre more inclined to the latter than the former (or if the former doesn‚Äôt sound like something that interests you), I‚Äôd encourage you to explore other majors, as their approach may be more suited to studying questions of that manner, and their curriculum might cater more towards your interests. \n\n**TL;DR:** *BNS is an amazing program if you‚Äôre genuinely interested in the science behind psychology, and is decent for pre-med. But if you‚Äôre looking for a major that can also serve as an effective backup if med doesn't work out, or if your goal is to have a career in science and you‚Äôre not sure if BNS is the field for you yet, make sure to do your research about the program, as going into it without a proper plan could put you at a disadvantage in terms of employability due to lack of wet/dry lab training and overly-specialized knowledge in the core curriculum.*"", 'I can speak for chem.

If taking courses with a bunch of memorizing is something you're decent at (which, if you're going for med, I'd assume you're at the very least prepared for), then even the upper-year BNS courses aren't that difficult, imo, and you can pad GPA with easier electives. I can't speak too much for chem, but from what I've heard, it does get pretty damn tough in later years, so that could be something to consider, as GPA might tank - although if you really enjoy chem, then ideally you'd perform well :)\n\nI personally wouldn't pick BNS just for the MCAT prep - the psych portion of the MCAT is just one section, so you'd learn way more about it than you'd need, which is only good if you're interested in it (in fact, I actually think a chem major would be a better option for this. You get the same issue of learning more about chem than you'd need, but imo you can self-study the psych portion of the MCAT way easier than the biochem).\n \nOne thing I did want to point out though: if you've realized research isn't for you, then getting a second degree in science could be a bit of a risky option - science degrees do prepare you most for science-based jobs, after all :) A chemistry degree would prepare you most for working in chemistry research, unless you're considering going into industry. And if you did want to work with chemistry in industry, depending on the type of job you'd want, you may want to consider a graduate degree in chemistry further down the line (it's possible to do well with just a bachelors, but definitely not as common nowadays).\n\nA lot to think about, so I don't mean to overwhelm you, haha.

https://twitter.com/amiewol45816678/status/1356973742899961857?s=21

This is clear retaliation against a very basic right for any UBC student: filing a complaint against an instructor or transferring out of a class that does not work for whatever reason. While Wolf is trying to spin this into a victim narrative of being ‚Äúsilenced‚Äù as an Indigenous prof (and tricking both The Ubyssey and The Peak into giving her favourable coverage without even talking to the other side), she very clearly admits that she posted the EXACT SAME REVIEW in 12 students‚Äô files as retaliation and is trying to hurt their career prospects now.

I really hope the students sue both Wolf and UBC, who allowed people like this into the institution and created this situation by transferring the students from the class.

Can you imagine paying UBC to help you become a teacher and then having the same institution diminish/destroy those chances because some prof judged you to be ‚Äúbad‚Äù and ‚Äúcolonialist‚Äù? What kind of bullshit is this?

1637345780.0,How to prepare For Finals,"Hey everyone My name is Jaymen and I'm a Student/Academic Coach/Tutor at UBC and thought id share some tips to prepare for finals as its that time of year again :DD

**A little bit about myself:** In grade 9 I failed math 9 and science 9 and was going to drop out of school because I thought I was too dumb for school. But there was a girl I had a crush on and I wanted to impress her so I started learning how to study and how to improve in school, and after a year I raised my average a lot. Over the years I've learned how to study better, and teach other students/clients how to raise their grades as well. 

**Key Principles:** 

**Its not about the outcome, but the process - Learning the difference between your character and your essence :)) -READ THIS FIRST IF YOU'RE GOING TO READ THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT**

here's a simple thought experiment: if a baby was born who would say ""wow this baby is such a deadbeat, they have no job and they dont have a perfect gpa"". Every single one of us is born more than enough and inherent with value, but somewhere along the line when we grew up, someone, or something convinced us that our character/avatar (our external) defines our value, when that's just not true. Realizing that you character is separate from your actual value is very important to challenging yourself with compassion and empathy. Whether you get a 100% on a final exam or you fail, it does not change your inherent value, its just like your videogame character. If you played a videogame, you can appreciate when you lose levels/are challenged because its not personal. I think its important to make this distinction as a lot of people tie their GPA to their self worth (I was definitely guilty of this) so try to remember that those things are separate and remind yourself of your worth :)) Once you're able to do this you can focus on the process of working hard (rather than trying to just get to an outcome - this is the number one way to burn yourself out). 

**Managing Mental health/Spirituality**

Finding balance between working hard (yang) and resting and chilling (yin) is an essential part of doing well and keeping your mental health in a good position. If you only exclusively chill in our yang centered world you will fall behind, but if you only work you will find yourself burnt out. I find it very helpful to slow down sometimes, do meditations, journal to remind myself of the balance between these two energies. Its like Fire and Water, and if you have too much fire you will get burned (yang) and if you have only water, there will be no fuel to move. 

**Starting early**

A rule of thumb is to start 25-30 days earlier (so around this time right now). And starting just means putting in a little bit of work (lowering the bar). Which means if you can spend 20 minutes doing a few practice problems allow yourself to get started. Often times there's a certain ""activation energy"" which students require to get started (they require a high level of stress to get started) and the reason for this is because they have raised the bar SO HIGH: ""I need to study for 4 hours"" .... ""I need to read all my chapters"" ... By lowering the bar it becomes easy to do small little things: 

**A little Goes a long way.../Lower the Bar**

the little amounts of practice and review over time allow you to learn this better, and also as a result lower your stress levels. By creating a very high bar, you actually condition yourself to ONLY study when you are VERY stressed (as you could imagine this is not good for your mental). By lowering the bar and giving yourself some compassion and empathy it becomes easier to do a little. There are days where I go to study and do 1 20 minute block of studying and get 3 practice questions done, then I go home. 

**Practicing Self Compassion/Empathy**

By lowering the bar and practicing some self compassion and empathy, I don't always have to study many hours, and I don't have to freak out on days when I don't want to study. Motivation and energy isn't consistent and always FORCING yourself (always) to do something will lead to burnout (sometimes you do need to just do it though). But by allowing myself to take breaks, and realize I'm not perfect and no one is, I can rest, and come back another day with energy to take on the tasks at hand. 

**Motivation is garbage/Mel robbins 5 second rule/Momentum and Drive/Passion**

As great as motivation is, it often times is not consistent and unreliable. Having a balance of self compassion and empathy is great, but challenging yourself and pushing yourself compassionately is important as well. By allowing yourself to fail, and falling in love with the process of working and pushing yourself (WITH COMPASSION KEY POINT) is so important to remain driven and being able to get things done (but again if you can't that's okay too :) ). On days where I'm really struggling I do use a bit of cheap motivation (listening to study motivations on youtube, just be careful of toxic positivity; not being compassionate enough to yourself).  But an important thing to realize is sometimes if you just need to move a little, you can use Mel Robbins 5 second rule, which is to just count from 5,4,3,2,1 and push yourself out of bed, the point of this is to realize that you do have a lot of power of what you do, but again, even if you don't that's okay too :)) 

**Finals Management/Organization**

Generally For finals, I start around 30 days before the final and set a daily quota (a minimum amount of practice questions I need to do for the day. And some days I will hit my bare minimum and that's okay too. 

&#x200B;

[Finals Management sheet Winter 2019 ](https://preview.redd.it/buwx5zc6mg081.png?width=1342&format=png&auto=webp&s=5205b5a64e48e0614226d8139bcbaec88a0ffcd0)

As you can see from the daily questions column, there are some days which are very productive, and some days where I'm just too tired to do anything, so I do the bare minimum (3 practice questions). But by being able to take breaks you actually allow yourself to become more productive. (note how after some days of 3,3 the numbers jump up a lot after I refresh my energy and ACTUALLY rest and give myself some destressing time. 

Note I had a point systems I came up with, and when I had a certain amount of points I would do something big like go clubbing, or go to a rave (pre pandemic of course) or a full day with friends or something. The key point is to actually be fair with yourself and give yourself a bit of compassion. Self compassion goes a long way to doing well and also maintaining your mental health. 

**Finding Problems/Using online Resources** 

A lot of students don't know this but other universities materials are ALL accessible online for free. In particular my favorite is Harvard OCHEM (you can search up harvard ochem and click the first link their canvas is public)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tutqw1dxmg081.png?width=2688&format=png&auto=webp&s=0efa56ec975b4a8054b93bba1364ead433f71f7b

all of this is public information but a lot of people don't know about it :OOO they have a purple book too which are guides for each of the concepts in chemistry. 

Finding this material isn't exclusive to chemistry though and can be used for psychology, statistics, math etc. 

to find specific material, it can be helpful to use keywords and filetype filtering. Lets say I want to do practice questions on octahedral splitting energy: 

https://preview.redd.it/h4kv5zjmvg081.png?width=2730&format=png&auto=webp&s=af523d05a97b1191f07dc28fb92a27508eeb5721

I can search ""topic"" + ""exam"" or ""homework"" or ""final"" filetype:pdf

this shows me all the PDFS with those topics related and when I click on one:

https://preview.redd.it/7xf2fxxsvg081.png?width=2732&format=png&auto=webp&s=504f8f485c3df74e64a3489e174a20de0a02e452

From here I can ERASE the part of the URL: Quiz3Fall09KEY.pdf:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q4mwl52xvg081.png?width=2735&format=png&auto=webp&s=1de00821cff1467e20e44bc039dfdd43966f8f84

which gets me to the class site. This gives a lot of access to practice material, practice homework, exams, study notes, outlines etc. (ill outline How I use this later in the studying section) 

**Types of studying/Time Management:**

**Prep/Project time:** Homework, creating flashcards, finding problems, finding study resources, finding videos to watch, Organizing study guides, Schedules and creating plans. 

**Learning (passive):** Watching YouTube videos, reviewing notes (different from studying material), thought experiments 

**Studying (active):** Full active flow studying/Pomodoro (continued section on this later) 

**Group study (Active/Passive Mix):** Meeting up with study groups, teaching concepts to friends/classmates, working through problem sets and homework's with peers 

each different type of studying takes a different investment of energy, and can be properly utilized based on levels of energy to adapt to different situations. Heres an example breakdown of my finals semester from 2019 (The app is Atracker: a good time management app) 

&#x200B;

[Total Exam preparation time per month \(in hours\) including all 4 types of studying](https://preview.redd.it/nxiz3w5dhg081.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=78a33e083f800e48f3a669063a9b7966638f7d74)

Generally my November is the packed month (month before finals) and December is more chill (to avoid overstress and burnout) . 132 hours per month is around 4.4 hours a day mixed between the 4 types of studying. Here are the numbers for each individual type: 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xh9fa6ncih081.png?width=2630&format=png&auto=webp&s=19f76e3b60d5972256a0f54377b5983d81ec2c99

I generally spend December doing more group studying (as its a lot easier, and less stressful leading up to the exam date) generally the amount of time spent studying per month (just pure flow focused studying) adds up to around 45/46 hours (1.5 hrs a day - around 4 Pomodoro blocks).

Its important to manage stress and energy levels so if im feeling too stressed or exhausted I will try to study with friends to chill a bit or watch some YouTube videos on the topic to passively learn. The key point is that a little goes a long way. 

**Study Techniques**

**3 Phase Study Technique**

**Phase 1 - information consolidation**

**- Learning goals:** reading the learning goals is a great way to know WHAT to study, and how to direct your study guides, and practice problems

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gs2paguaxg081.png?width=1471&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b4252bd500347093ea8114a01dc6f0b47e68f05

Heres an example for the current chem class im taking, and stuff I need to know prepping for the final (its modified from another university - Hence why using the filetype:pdf is so powerful because all the resources are out there) 

\- **Study guides:** Study guides are a compilation of key topics and what you need to know and tips/tricks for the exam: 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1803rfvtwg081.png?width=1401&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf6aaa5c0faddfcf4ba093b710980f1414626e82

Heres a page from one of my Chem study guides. The difference between notes and a study guide, is when you are creating a study guide you are trying not to copy things verbatim, but rather write it as if you are teaching someone (imagine you're going to send this study guide to a friend) 

**- Key concepts/Readings:** this may be controversial, but I don't do all the assigned readings, atleast in a science course, as I often find it redundant and a waste of time. Instead I focus on the learning goals, and if I have a gap in my understanding, then I go to the readings/textbook to figure out what I'm not understanding. When you're reading something its very easy to say ""Oh I know that"" without actually knowing the concept.

**- Problem sources locating:** this is one of my favourite things to do because its very passive and I can do it while watching netflix and chilling. As shown above just finding links to practice exams, and practice material and adding it to my favorites bar for courses is something I do when im very lazy and just don't want to do work.

**- Anki cards:** I use anki cards in conjunction with lecture slides (using the image occlusion feature), basically it allows you to take information from a lecture slide, cover it up and practice recalling what the information is. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0v4h069kyg081.png?width=2733&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a953561b59dbf2de9332e847d4f3859adebe562

Heres an example from chemistry, where I cover the answer and have to recall what the product is. This method of consolidating information is very efficient and easy to make (the cards - its very passive i love watching Netflix while I do it) 

**-I don't take notes/Unless its a whiteboard class/Prof doesnt post the notes:** this may sound counterintuitive, but taking notes when the professor posts the lecture AND the notes is actually inefficient as you have to use brain power to write down notes as you're listening. If the notes are posted its better to pay your full attention to what they are saying and come back to it later. I try to only write down key important information that maybe they don't write on the notes ie: ""this is an exam type question"" 

**Key goal: What do I need to know and why does it happen?**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Phase 2 - application** 

**- Problem sets** 

All the problems and materials I found in phase 1, can be used for phase 2 where I create problem sets of key problems I think will be on exams, and fundamental concepts which will be tested: 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p0v81iu3zg081.png?width=971&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fdfe85918575ae61ace409a40a55365811dbf2a

ALWAYS put the link of where you got it from so you can go back and find the answers! I just have a document where I go through the practice questions and then mark them with a different color so I can identify mistakes, and errors in my thinking (important for phase 3) 

**- Textbook questions** 

doing the assigned textbook questions is often good too as its most related to the course

**- Office hour questions** 

going through problem sets If I don't understand a concept or get something wrong and can't figure it out, I try my best to go to office hours and clarify with a TA or the professor. Understanding WHY you don't get something is very important in the learning process. 

**- Answer piazza questions**

trying to answer questions will reveal gaps in your knowledge. By not being able to explain something fully it often means there's a gap in your knowledge. 

**- Teach fellow students**

this follows the principles of the Feynman technique - which is to learn as if you are teaching the material: again helping you identify where the gaps in your knowledge are. 

**- Test Banks**

test banks for certain textbooks can be purchased online, which are basically PDFS from the publisher of the textbook for LOTS of practice problems related to the material (it costs around 50$ so you can find some friends in the class to split it with): 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vv8dfds20h081.png?width=1671&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa9545b3213cb73a4e268d9c47faf287ee4ca517

**Key goal: How can I apply these concepts?**

&#x200B;

**Phase 3 - Preparation (this is a little EXTRA and not necessary)** 

**- Mock exams:** Doing practice problems under non stressful conditions is very different from doing a practice exam in your room at home. its good to practice exam under mock exam conditions (at school if possible), with a timer, no phone and no notes. Sometimes Ill go into an empty lecture hall and do it as if it were an actual exam (with the timer up on the big screen). 

**- Common mistakes:** while doing practice, common mistakes will come up and there will be common questions which you may get wrong/questions you don't understand. Its good to come up with a key document where you highlight what some of these mistakes are. 

&#x200B;

[common mistakes document for CHEM 233](https://preview.redd.it/dyofbhxuch081.png?width=1408&format=png&auto=webp&s=3268bbd57bc3b52ac515573d63454d77c0239d49)

&#x200B;

**- Question consolidation:** all the key questions and concepts which may come up on the exam/you can ask in office hours.

**- Test taking technique:** Each course has different key mistakes/questions and things that may be tricky on an exam, so I develop a test taking technique for the particular course: 

&#x200B;

[Test taking technique for Chemistry](https://preview.redd.it/9wijzzridh081.png?width=1427&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6e06586a7138d3c342a17be36bf3e2691c63d25)

**- Shortcuts:** there Are certain questions which may take longer on an exam, so I come up with tricks to quickly arrive at the answer: heres an example for OCHEM (a visualization trick) 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9zkitfn3eh081.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=40867f6f5bf9b53c8f294cdfb234d4ee002ed37c

**-Memorization tricks/Models:** Some pieces of information can be encoded in different ""models"" (Models help encode information by relating it to some other piece of information): 

&#x200B;

[Model Describing ARIO in chemistry using emotions](https://preview.redd.it/ptjed57leh081.png?width=1340&format=png&auto=webp&s=84490b69ff08cf352b14abe8c29ebae402605caa)

Relating the information to other things you understand helps to understand things, and an example of a memorization trick is: 

&#x200B;

[EDG hexagon \(trick to remember groups for electron donating groups\) ](https://preview.redd.it/7o6pmqlzeh081.png?width=1771&format=png&auto=webp&s=66ad60ca49a5ddd35105695efc8c5f49fce7363e)

Always look passionate calculating HnmR is a way to to remember how groups work on a particular group in chemistry (and it encodes the information in an easy way).

**- Finals Spreadsheet:** I mentioned this earlier but its a great way to keep motivated, and stay on track in terms of practice, having a location where you can track your progress. 

**Key goal: How can I get perform the highest on an exam using the Information I have** 

**Study Programs**

When I first started studying I often found myself confused with what to do and how to approach it, and then I started to look at athletes training regimens and realized they incorporate rest and practice into a schedule (like a workout program), it can very effective to plan a study program to stay on track and avoid burnout, heres an example of one of my old 12 DTE programs (12 days till exam - generally used for a midterm) 

**Study outline A3 (12 dte) 24 hour program**   

**Day 1 - (Passive)** \- 5-6 hours full reading go through material   

**Day 2 - (Active)** \- (First 2 hours can be to catch up for reading) 2-3 Quizlet practice of key terminologies  

**Day 3 - (Active)** 1-2 hours Chapter reviews - test bank practicing  

**Day 4 - (Passive/active)** 1-2 hours look over notes, use encoding techniques to get core info  

**Day 5 - (Passive)** (1-2 hours)  libre-text read throughs  

**Day 6 -** rest  

**Day 7 -** Quizlet/Anki terminology reviews (1 hour)   

**Day 8 - (ACTIVE)** \- MOCK EXAM (0.5-1.5 Hrs)   

**Day 9 - (Passive)** Note review with active revision, and test revision  

**Day 10 -** rest  

**Day 11- (ACTIVE)** \- 5-6 hours active revision; quizlet, done practice tests, notes   

**Day 12-** RELAX DAY üì∑   

**Day 13 -** EXAM DAY 

**Pomodoro (and what works for you) / Flow state** 

The purpose of Pomodoro is to study efficiently, take breaks and access flow state. For everyone its different, so you need to play around with what works for you. But by actively practicing with breaks you can create flow, and learn get back into flow fast as well (this is like a startup time). If you constantly study with a low efficiency, you essentially train your brain to encode information in an inefficient way. By learning how to get your brain running at high efficiency faster (switch between on and off) you can create more efficiency and also get stuff done when you lower the bar (20 minute study session for example). This is an example of what a pomodoro block studying looks like: 

So generally I like to start my study sessions with a warmup to get into the groove of studying first  

**Nov 14, 2021:**

I started with a **30 minute active warmup block**  (Passive active mix of reading and practice problems)

**5 minute break**  

**28 minute study block**  

**5 minute break**   

**31 minute study block (passive and active)** 

**5 minute break**  

**28 minute study block (active practice questions)**   

**5 minute break**  

**28 minute study block (passive, learning the concepts)** 

**Bigger break - 15 minutes**  

**52 minute Active double block**   

**10 minute double break**  

**Subject switch to Ochem - 30 minute anki block/practice finals**  

**5 minute rest**   

**31 minute block coordination chemistry**  

**5 minute rest**   

**22 minute final quota finished** 

once you get into flow sometimes its beneficial to do a double block not to break flow state. Takes practice to switch between the two, and I generally listen to **hardstyle EDM rave/festival music** to get into the groove.

if I don't feel focused (my efficiency is not at a high level) sometimes I may do one block, and then leave, either going to a different study spot (as not to ruin the environment), or go do passive work somewhere else. If you ""half study"" at a certain spot you will associate that spot with inefficient studying. I've literally gone to study, not felt it and was like :

So I don't ruin that study spot. Sometimes its beneficial to also switch up study spots (having multiple study spots on campus).","['A rare high quality post on r/UBC   \n\n\nupdoot', 'At first I thought this was gonna be an eng phys Jayden post, but wow was I wrong', ""This man really spilled his entire studying techniques to us, for free.

Note 2: Links to the BC Gratuities and Redistribution of Gratuities Act will be at the bottom. 

Tipping culture needs to gooooo and the only way tipping culture will end here is if we all collectively stop doing it and spread the message. With inflation and the cost of living soaring in BC, plus the fact that all BC worker make a minimum of $16 no matter the industry is more than enough reason to end it. 

‚Ä¢ Argument that it supplements a workers wage because they don‚Äôt make minimum wage

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-False in BC it‚Äôs law that all workers make minimum wage. 

‚Ä¢Argument that workplaces automatically take 5%-10% of you wage to tip out no matter what 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-That‚Äôs illegal and you should contact the proper authorities as the the law clearly states only gratuities can be pooled and split 

‚Ä¢ Argument that it‚Äôs a service job and someone‚Äôs doing something for you, like walking back and forth from the kitchen‚Ä¶. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî There‚Äôs many many many service jobs that exist that don‚Äôt take tips and make minimum wage only. Why is that someone who works at McDonald‚Äôs and arguably has a much more stressful job than someone working at Cactus server, makes no tips but the cactus server does. 


I would like to discuss this with further will be and would love to hear what other people think. Personally I think the message needs to spread now more than ever. The only way we stop the culture is to actually stop doing it ourselves. Collectively we could make it end and it could also start making work places pay a livable wage to people.

I think that's a hard sell politically when you see headlines of cornerstone restaurants in Vancouver shutting down due to rising costs/lower number of customers, and an ongoing labour shortage. \n\nI would love to not tip anymore but I don't think there is a pathway locally where employees, employers, politicians, and public sentiment would all align to make that a reality."", 'Employers should be the one that pays its employees, not directly from customers', 'Minimum wages need to grow to keep up with inflation, and should be living wages. No one should have to tip out on their total sales (which nearly all servers have to), and then maybe, we could get rid of tipping. But until we have better economic justice than the current shit show, tips are how people are feeding their kids.', ""Ive been in the hospitality industry for over 15 years, not here to dismiss many of  these valid points. I too am frustrated by the increase in expectation to tip in new scenarios, let alone to say nothing of the expected minimum. I would guess that in many instances people in fast service are merely trying to supplement their income to keep up with a higher cost of living. Im hit or miss on this. I think a secondary cause that drives this trend is the transition to cards and away from cash. Tipping has been accepted in fast service for years, but the switch over to POS terminals with tip prompts has made it much more visible whereas in the past it was your decision to drop a loonie or change into a jar afterwards. The software on those Square terminals can be aggressive, when a terminal is turned around to you with preloaded 18/20/22 options for walk up service is asking over what is being provided. During the pandemic when places refused to accept cash and went over to a tap only payment with preloaded tip options included is borderline theft to the consumer by the business. For decades, an archaic law that allowed employers to pay below the minimum wage for servers/bartenders was the justification for the current tipping structure. In BC that was eliminated 3-4 years ago and now wages are on par with the provincial minimums. There definitely has been a democratization in the expectation of tipping, whereas in the past it was confined to restaurants or places with higher levels of service. Expanding this to nearly every retail scenario does appear excessive, as not all of these places traditionally made the sub-minimum server wage. I agree that everyone deserves to make a living wage and it should be up to the employer to make up that difference.\n\nHowever, this thread and discussion is missing two major repercussions from transitioning away from tipping culture, both of which are intertwined.\n\nMany of the people that work in highly skilled service positions are able to remain in those positions because of the wages that tipping affords them. (If you care to argue that chefs, bartenders and servers are not highly skilled individuals, you have absolutely no idea what youre talking about. Of course, not all of them, use examples of your own positive experiences as a guide). If employers absorb that cost in labor by increasing paid wages, you're going to immediately see $30 hamburgers and $15 beers. While you might cringe at constantly having to tip, the cost of tipping is directly calculated into overhead and cost for an outlet. Ever see the price of a cocktail in Australia or Iceland?  The prices that you currently see are able to remain that way because labor costs is one of the highest, if not the single highest, cost for any restaurant. If you want that same burger, with the same quality and service, get prepared to pay double. And because labor cost for outlets is roughly 30%-40% of total cost, if you took a $16 wage and made it roughly $25-30, the amount that margins would need to be adjusted would be far more costly  than percentages under the current structure.\n\nThe second part to this is to assume that not all restaurants can or will afford to increase wages in their business model. In that case, get prepared to see service and attitude absolutely plummet. If you now have an entire workforce that has absolutely no incentive to give a shit because theyre gonna make the same wage either way, dont expect the same smile and friendly attitude in every place you go to. There would be such a mass exodus of talent from the industry that it would transform every dining experience. Its a tough job, the hours are long and people can be extremely difficult. Dealing with the drunken public is not easy and the compensation that tipping provides is the incentive for putting up with that. Ever been told to fuck off in the UK, or see a bartender who can make you wait 20 minutes for a beer? Thats what flat hospitality wages encourages. The benefit of tipping is that youre able to attract and retain highly talented and motivated individuals who can make or break a restaurant.  Do you not think that McDonalds tries to find the best labor it can attract with a minimum wage? Extrapolate that outwards to all of your future dining scenarios.\n\nOf course I admit that many of these statements have obvious exceptions and counter examples, Ive had terrible service and still tipped on it. It doesnt guarantee that you'll get the service of your life either. I understand the frustration that tip culture and gouging can bring, but I think its important to acknowledge that the system does provide benefits for both consumer and worker.  Rising inflation and higher food costs sting even more with added 15% tip cost at the end, I understand the frustration. If your only concern is to mitigate that cost, keep in mind that eliminating the current tip system comes with a trade off.\n\nOr, if you dont want to tip, just dont."", '$16 is poverty wages.

This creates an ‚Äúunder the table‚Äù nature to what is being paid for when one tips.

If you can't tip because you can't afford it, by all means, don't tip; we're all broke college students.

The big problem is that the prices of food and drinks haven\'t gone up at the same rate as what our suppliers are charging. Your $16 burger and fries and beer is a relic of the past. We should be charging $25-30, but no one wants to pay that much. Eating out used to be a luxury for special occasions. Now people eat at restaurants multiple times a week.\n\nFor context, back in 2021, a case of romaine lettuce from one of our large international suppliers went from $40 to $120 temporarily. We lost money on every Caesar salad we sold. We could\'ve sold a salad for $40 and kept our margins, but who\'s gonna buy that when the place next door has a Caesar salad for $14 and is just biting the cost bullet? It\'s a catch-22 that has seen restaurants closing all over the country. It\'s why cooks are stereotypically paid way less than the other red seal trades. Margins are the slimmest they\'ve been in years. Tipping, while a broken system, helps to alleviate some of the stress. It keeps menu costs down, keeps labour costs down, and ensures we can provide you a service that isn\'t hemorrhaging us money.\n\nIn a perfect world, restaurant prices would rise 30-60%, cooks and servers would be paid better hourly, tipping averages would fall, and you would still receive the same service you would otherwise, but until the general public is ready to pay A LOT more for their meals, tipping in here to stay, whether you like it or not.\n\nAlso as a side note, tipping nothing usually means the server loses money. In BC they\'re generally required to tip out other staff. For example, 3-4% of liquor sales to the bartender, 1-2% of total sales to support staff (food runners, bussers, hosts) and 3-5% of food sales to the kitchen. No tip means that all comes out of their own pocket, unless management has a ""no tip, no tip-out"" policy. If you\'re not comfortable with the 18-25% that gets pushed nowadays, totally support that.

I‚Äôm honestly not sure what the point of engaging in a collaborative learning process is if you don‚Äôt want to participate. Like I genuinely don‚Äôt know what to say. Maybe shit works differently in Canada, but in the countries I‚Äôve studied, students have been expected to participate in class and not just sit there and whine about having to communicate with classmates.

I know quite a few brilliant people who want to avoid unnecessary social interactions, have a strong academic standing, and has a personality outside of academics. So I don‚Äôt know, call them normal people at least? You have to realize as an instructor that there are many types of students. If all that you‚Äôre familiar with is a program that centers around communication, well, students who don‚Äôt like that won‚Äôt be there in the first place. It literally doesn‚Äôt make sense to say a student can‚Äôt be successful because they don‚Äôt want to talk to peers. Heck, I‚Äôd say it doesn‚Äôt even reflect their actual social capabilities, ALOT of the times these group activities are just plain useless, many students choose not to participate in them.', 'Ninja edits I see? How is questioning one‚Äôs qualification an asshole behavior? How do you think people should react when apparently an instructor makes an outrageous claim?

Be comfortable with being uncomfortable. Also happy cake day', 'Yeah so we‚Äôre gonna just keep being pointlessly rude and deliberately obtuse then, are we? Yeah that‚Äôs totally my argument and not a straw man. Nobody can have preferences and everyone has to learn the exact same way. That‚Äôs clearly what I was saying. \n\nFor real tho, It sounds like you‚Äôre just taking what I said personally and projecting your experiences with useless group activities. Clearly you have some difficulties with communicating, and I can see how a really abrasive person would struggle in most collaborative environments. So sorry if I offended you. \n\nObviously break out rooms can be used well or they can be pointless. But what I‚Äôm saying is that categorically writing them off because you don‚Äôt like participating in class isn‚Äôt the sign of a motivated student, unless you‚Äôre socially anxious, and I specifically referred to how my student with anxiety liked them more because they were smaller. I was never a hugely extroverted student and tended to be standoffish, but when there were group activities, I‚Äôd try to contribute, because it‚Äôs not just about you personally. Learning in a class is inherently collaborative; it‚Äôs a team effort. It‚Äôs selfish in a sense not to participate, because it forces your peers to carry the class, and they may not want to either. It‚Äôs also literally a requirement of almost every course I‚Äôve ever participated in that you contribute in class. So, no, in the programs I‚Äôve taken, you can‚Äôt be a successful student if you can‚Äôt be asked to speak.', 'Okay you‚Äôre even more socially inept than I thought if you don‚Äôt grasp how immediately saying you doubt someone is qualified to do what is literally their career is going to come off as douchey. Whatever, I get stellar reviews on my teaching, and that‚Äôs what matters. How well I connect with my students, not what random people on the internet think of the words I use to describe students who refuse to participate in courses.', 'I did not write-off breakout rooms. What I said was that students should not be judged based on their willingness to participate, and that group activities are useless at times. I have no problem with instructors implementing group activities and advocating for it, in fact group projects are some of the moments when I put in the most effort, despite disliking them. \n\nMoreover, the basis of this argument is about ‚Äúwanting‚Äù and ‚Äúlike‚Äù to participate or not. If you make participation mandatory, how would you know if your students truly want to do it or not? The majority of the opinions I‚Äôve seen are against breakout rooms, so clearly people don‚Äôt want it, but yet most people still participate. You may think I‚Äôm picking on your word choice here, but even for those who actually don‚Äôt participate, there‚Äôs no reasonable way I can just write them off as bad students. \n\nUltimately, teaching philosophies are subjective, even if the whole faculty staff believes collaboration helps learning, students are the ones who knows what works for them. And once again, whether you believe it or not, I know quite a few brilliant and motivated individuals who shy away from collaboration when they deem it unnecessary. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if someone did a study and found no correlation between academic abilities and willingness to talk.', 'I don‚Äôt make participation mandatory.  I said the majority of the courses I‚Äôve been in do. I‚Äôm a PhD student so my teaching has been as a TA, I don‚Äôt make the rules. I just design and give lectures, meet with students for one on one help, lead labs, and grade. In the last course I taught, due to the pandemic and all, the main prof waived the participation requirement. \n\nThis conversation was about breakout groups sucking. I took that as them being ineffective, not simply as people not liking them. I‚Äôm not saying you have to love them, just that if you feel they can‚Äôt be effective, it‚Äôs probably more telling of you as a student then of the method as a whole. And I say this because it‚Äôs effective with motivated students in my experience. And they also tend to say they‚Äôre helpful and enjoyable as well. So if you just say ‚Äúbreakout groups suck, screw them,‚Äù you‚Äôre writing off what could be an edifying experience and doing your classmates a disservice. Because they might not be stoked on them either, but they put the effort in to make the class work. \n\nIn my course, which is about scientific writing, I felt that having peer review sessions was really important, because in my experience, reading other authors and identifying their strengths and weaknesses improves your own writing a lot. So I‚Äôd use them for that, as well as sessions where people would do activities like improving the diction in excerpts or finding ways to be more concise. That was important because when I did it with the whole class, everyone couldn‚Äôt contribute due to time constraints, so breaking out let the groups discuss and all weigh in and then contribute as a group to the overall discussion. The reason the course was a success has much less to do with me and much more to do with the students all recognizing the challenges of the scenario and doing their best to participate and make it work. Chiming in instead of letting a new teacher sit there with crickets. Being enthusiastic participants that helped the team learn. \n\nBeing a good student isn‚Äôt just about being smart. I aced everything and never contributed unless I had to through high school. I was a bad student with straight a‚Äôs. So if you don‚Äôt like breakout groups, that‚Äôs one thing, but if you say they suck and don‚Äôt contribute, you‚Äôre not being a good student. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying.', 'Now, this then comes down to your definition of a good student. Because earlier you equated a student who doesn\'t care to participate to "" there because their parents made them, only at the bare minimum number of lectures to pass, never anything to contribute, never doing the reading "". However, the truth is, just because they don\'t want to participate, doesn\'t mean they only do the bare minimum. For a lot of people, participation is their only issue on that list, it doesn\'t automatically come with all the other negatives.\n\nIf your definition of a bad student is someone who doesn\'t want to participate because that trait automatically comes with a bunch of other negative traits, then I have to say you\'re wrong. If that\'s not what you meant, more likely so, then I can\'t argue further because this has now come down to subjectivity. Because my definition of a good student is narrower than yours. You can be a good student if you have good grades and engage only in what you care about, and it\'s fine if participation is not one of them, especially if you narrow it down to ""breakout rooms in 20/21"". It\'s not required in order to be successful.', 'Idk what to say. Your educational culture is apparently just different from any of the countries I‚Äôve studied or taught in. I‚Äôve always been taught that an essential part of the learning process is collaboration and participation. Otherwise I could just learn the material on my own, which I‚Äôve done with shit that goes down more easily that way for me. Like I just don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôd join a class not wanting to participate. \n\nThat‚Äôs what I did as a kid when education was mandatory. Show up, sleep through class, ace the test, move on. If your mentality as a college student is simply to bag the grade and whine about having to talk to classmates, it‚Äôs not an issue of your ability to pass courses, it‚Äôs an issue of your inability to collaborate with people, or else of your decision to join a class you don‚Äôt want to contribute to. And obviously I‚Äôm talking about breakout rooms as a reflection of participation generally, they‚Äôre just the current situation‚Äôs version of small group participation. Don‚Äôt strawman me again into saying ‚Äúif you didn‚Äôt enjoy your particular instructor‚Äôs group assignment in 2020, you‚Äôre a bad student‚Äù because that‚Äôs never been my argument at all and, again, we‚Äôd have to be deliberately obtuse if not just  dumb to take anything I said that way. But one of those two are going on, and, frankly, it‚Äôs and indictment of this uni if it‚Äôs controversial to say that people who don‚Äôt want to participate in group leaning endeavors don‚Äôt really belong in them.']",829

You\'ll be banned for admissions fraud. Review application ethics here.\n\n##**Common Myths:**\n\n###Myth 1: Going straight into a major.\n\nPlease be mindful that specializations for many faculties are chosen in second or third year, based on your GPA at UBC (not your high school average).\n\nExample 1: There is no direct entry into Computer Science from high school, and you would apply after completing your first year of UBC Science or Arts, or in the summer before Commerce first year.\n\nExample 2: There is no direct entry into English from high school. You would declare it after completing your first year of UBC Arts (there may be other procedures depending on your degree program) in SSC. There is no application process (except for honours).\n\n###Myth 2: The ""internal transfer loophole""/""It\'s easier to transfer within UBC/from another university.\n\nNearly just about everyone who is rejected for their first choice (e.g. Science, Sauder) and who puts down Forestry, Arts, SFU or UBC-O as their backup option, has a big brain moment where they think that they\'ll take the offer that they have no interest in, with the intention to transfer to the UBC faculty they want to get into. This is usually informed by some misguided, desperate attempt to study at UBC, and the belief that it\'ll be an easier transition. This rarely works, and every year, a large proportion of people, believing in the internal transfer myth, posts on reddit about how their academic plans, dreams and lives have been derailed.\n\nIt is not easier to transfer between UBCO to UBC Vancouver, or between the Faculty of Arts/Forestry -> another faculty. UBCO/SFU/UVic/other university students do not have an advantage over transfer college students (and this may even be the opposite).\n\nYou require the same grades as you would if you were transferring between schools. High school students sometimes consider UBC (and other university) courses to be harder than their college-transfer counter-parts. Not all credits from UBC-O transfer to UBC Vancouver. They are considered to be separate schools curriculum wise.\n\nThink hard and wisely on why you may have been rejected from your first choice. Every student convinces themselves that they\'ll do better on the next try. We\'re all guilty of it; but we rarely follow through. It\'s common knowledge that getting great grades in high school is not a predictor of whether you\'ll do exceptionally well in university, but getting grades that don\'t meet the cutoff for your first choice program is generally a good predictor of whether you won\'t do well in your first year, especially if you\'re studying something that you have no interest in or your calculus background is weak.\n\nExternal transfers from college transfer programs such as Corpus Christi College, Langara and Douglas tend to be issued much earlier than internal transfers. For all intents and purposes, external transfers take precedence over internal transfers.\n\nIf your end goal is to study business and you were only admitted to UBC Arts, then you should take the Beedie offer, and failing that, you should register for a college transfer program. If your end goal is to study science, and you were only admitted to UBC Forestry, then take the SFU offer in science, and failing that, register for college transfer program.\n\nUnless you\'re exceedingly confident that you can pull this off or wouldn\'t mind graduating with a degree in your second choice, it\'s almost never a good idea to try and transfer from Arts, Forestry, or UBC-O to a program at UBC.\n\nWe say this after having heard nearly a hundred stories about the stories where people didn\'t make it. We\'re serious: Don\'t take this decision lightly.\n\n###Myth 3: ECs make your Personal Profile\n\nThere is an enduring myth that the number and type of Extracurricular Activities you list in your personal profile equates to how good your personal profile is. This is false, and several above-average students who feel that they wrote above average personal profiles are consistently waitlisted for UBC. At the same time, students with few ECs or just a single part time job are admitted in early admissions without issue.\n\nIt should be obvious that not everyone applying for UBC comes from an upper-class, highly-ranked school background, and that many of the supposed very strong ECs such as leading a club, winning national writing awards or saving puppies from Ebola are simply not available to youth in many parts of the world, especially those from rural or Indigenous communities. Some ECs considered strong by high school students are actually very weak, dubious or even unethical, such as voluntourism (aka volunteering abroad) or claiming to found a non-profit organization/NGO with no clear impact or scale.\n\nSeriously, when 1 out of every 3 applicants is the founder of a ""student-run not-for-profit organization dedicated to xyz"", a Model UN ""Secretariat"" or ""Vice President of Engagement and Special Projects"", it\'s not unique, leadership experience or remotely interesting: it\'s giving yourself a loaded title.\n\nThere is no sugar coating this. Personal profiles are largely scored by alumni, who are at a fundamentally different place in life with a much different understanding of what is important and meaningful, and what is not. What may seem like a killer EC for you (i.e. saving 100 puppies from Covid-19), will probably read like a poorly articulated attempt to pad your resume to anyone past their second year at UBC, while a minimum wage job delivering newspapers or helping your mom battle cancer*, may read as a genuine commitment to hard work, perseverance and investment in your community. (Note: Family responsibilities are considered a valid leadership activity)\n\nYour personal profile is scored based on how profound, exceptional and meaningful your accomplishments were, especially in the context of your personal development and resiliency. If your answers just list out various responsibilities you had while volunteering or brag about the non-profit you run, you have a bad personal profile. When you claim you had a great or terrible personal profile because of how many ECs you have, everyone here rolls their eyes, and either moves onto the next question or will call you out with this myth.\n\nIn the words of one PP scorer: Don\'t write what you think we want to hear. Write in a way that shows us who you really are.\n\n###Myth 4: Admissions offers are handed out linearly\n\nJust because your friend Sally from Surrey got an offer before you, doesn\'t mean that you were passed over for an offer or that you\'re less qualified for UBC than they are. Admissions offers are processed in batches of students with similar backgrounds.\n\nBatches might include: International IB students, BC students in Linear systems applying for Arts, BC students in Semester Systems, AB students, Transfer students from BC, UBC-O transfers, ON students with a first choice in Science, Domestic students applying for Sauder.\n\nThere\'s no point getting anxious when other people on reddit have gotten an offer before you have. It doesn\'t really mean much; you should start worrying when you\'re waitlisted or rejected, not beforehand.\n\n###Myth 5: That we know what we\'re talking about\n\nThe vast majority of people who are answering questions on this thread are either other applicants, or current UBC students. Other applicants tend to not know more than you might from a bit of Googling, and the current UBC students are the ones that have made it (you don\'t see rejected applicants hanging around, telling you if the ""good advice"" is actually wrong).\n\nWe aren\'t admissions officers, and there are way more factors than what you think your calculated GPA is, or how well you think you did on a personal profile question. We don\'t really know how grades are weighted, how current personal profiles are scored, and how many seats will exist for X and Y program this year. We can\'t tell you if you have a good case for appealing a decision. We can\'t predict how much money the provincial government will be awarding this year for domestic student seats.\n\n**In reality, if you have a question about admission, you should be calling or emailing admissions.

UBC is notorious for their long application process. i know it sucks and it‚Äôs frustrating, but you‚Äôve just gotta be patient. \n\n- they don‚Äôt send out offers by province or location in Canada, so if you‚Äôre seeing other people receive offers but you haven‚Äôt heard anything, what province they‚Äôre from doesn‚Äôt matter. Even if people from your school have heard back and you haven‚Äôt, it doesn‚Äôt really mean anything. The only time a province can ‚Äúbenefit‚Äù you is in the case of Alberta, because the high school curriculum is harder so when you apply to UBC your grades get a bit of a boost; But it does not affect when you‚Äôll hear back. \n\n- if you applied for early admissions but didn‚Äôt hear anything back, it only means that you didn‚Äôt make early admissions, not that you‚Äôre rejected. they‚Äôll just review your application with everyone else‚Äôs during the general round of admissions, so you still very much have a shot. \n\n- if it looks like there‚Äôs an error on your admissions portal (ie, you know you‚Äôve submitted all your required documentation but your status is still saying that document upload is required before they can review your application) call admissions ASAP. they‚Äôll fix this. \n\n- check your admissions portal, but you‚Äôll also receive an email if you‚Äôre offered admission. i got the email before i had a chance to check my portal that day, and that‚Äôs how i found out. \n\n- unless an explicit rejection, waitlist deferral, or acceptance is updated in your admissions portal, your application is still being reviewed, therefore you have a chance. you might get several different update messages regarding the status of your application, but it‚Äôs not over until you receive an official status of one of the three previously stated decisions. \n\n- remember applications are holistic. just because someone with a higher grade average than you got rejected, it doesn‚Äôt mean you will. \n\n- admission offers are faculty dependent, so comparing yourself to someone else isn‚Äôt really beneficial in general, but comparing yourself to someone who applied to a different faculty is ESPECIALLY a waste of time. \n\n- UBC is a good school but even if you are rejected, i promise you‚Äôll be okay and find the school/path that‚Äôs right for you. the world doesn‚Äôt end if you don‚Äôt go to UBC, in fact, some people are better off because of it. \n\ngood luck everyone, keep your head up :)', ""To anyone who's heart is not set on ubc, please decline your offer to allow admissions to other students as soon as possible :)"", ""alrighty it's confirmed that they're done with early admissions! like SleepyEatsMuffins said, we all can get in.

Its hard to rant to my friends because they're either in IB and super smart and UBC is considered their safety school, or I feel like I seem boastful when I'm talking to my friends going to Langara.

Like what am I even mad about, the fact that they are so smart and well rounded and deserve to go to UBC???

And then my mom was like yeah be grateful that we live like a half an hour drive away from UBC otherwise you would be like all those students applying to schools halfway across the country and having to pay thousands upon thousands of dollars and being so far away from your family.   \n  \nAnd dang that is all I have been thinking about. I have been so caught up in my ego and obsession with this university that I have completely overlooked how privileged I am. Like the fact that I live in BC is already insane enough, but also to have such a good university that almost 60,000 people from all over the world attend that is in driving distance from my home, that if I get into ubc I can still see my family and friends every single day, and I don't have to explore a new city all on my own as a little 18 year old.  \n\nAnyways, I would sincerely like to congratulate everybody that has gotten in.

To waitlisted/under eval applicants: you still have a chance! Good luck!\n\n2. PLEASE choose a university or college where you were admitted to your desired program. It's more important to study what you want than to be stuck trying to transfer unless you're 100% getting in.\n\n3. If you're dead set on transferring, go to a college!!!\n\n4. no matter what, be proud of your accomplishments! you have amazing grades, you put in your all, and got into many great schools already!\n\n\n\nI got waitlisted from my first choice (sauder) and accepted into arts, but this applies to anyone whose first choice was a specific program and 2nd choice arts/ubco/a program you don't want and intend to transfer out of. \n\n  \nfirst, if you are waitlisted or still being under eval, you have a great chance of getting in. don't lose hope. especially those under eval. yes, there are less spots as it's nearing the end of admissions, but they started looking at you the latest which means they are still deliberating and you do have a good chance - i saw many people with this status get accepted last year.\n\nsecond, if you are waitlisted or rejected from your 1st choice, but accepted into your 2nd, PLEASE do your research. \n\nother unis such as SFU have grading systems that make it hard to transfer into UBC. UBC arts isn't the amazing transfer path everyone says it is; neither is UBCO. you have a better chance in transfer colleges, where you can achieve higher grades and less pressure. internal transfers DO NOT have more leverage than external transfers!\n\nif you got accepted into a uni with a difficult program to get into, such as architecture, engineering, compsci - consider them!! ubc doesn't do direct entry. even if you work hard to transfer, you need to separately apply for engineering specializations or compsci. \n\nit's more important to be in your desired program and start studying towards what you want to do, than to be in a 'more' prestigious school! if you don't see yourself in ANY arts program, DO NOT risk going to arts and being stuck there!\n\nsfu beedie has VERY similar opportunities to ubc sauder; it just doesn't carry the same name, and may hold less prestige if you intend to work outside of Canada."", '[deleted]', 'no matter what happens today let‚Äôs all live ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè', 'why can‚Äôt ubc just accept me or reject me, i just want an answer', 'Who‚Äôs ready for July 30 Deadline üíÄüòà.

International undergraduate students pay significantly higher tuition fees, unaided by funding from B.C. taxpayers.‚Äù\n\nTo answer everyone‚Äôs questions on here, yes internationals and domestic students get offered different spots or from what I‚Äôve been reading on this thread, ‚Äúfixed quotas.‚Äù So let‚Äôs say Suzy (international student) gets waitlisted, that doesn‚Äôt mean any less for Johnny (domestic) because Suzy is trying to get admitted for a non-gov‚Äôt funded spot while Johnny is competing for the gov‚Äôt funded spots. \n\n‚ÄúIs it easier for international students to get accepted? \n\nThe university first evaluates domestic applicants to ensure that the most qualified students are offered admission to the domestic, government-funded spaces. This competitive process determines the marks required to gain admission ‚Äì typically far above the minimum standard.‚Äù\n\nTo answer everyone‚Äôs questions again, it seems as if UBC prioritizes domestic students in comparison to international. This could be why a majority of you are waitlisted to ensure that the domestic students fill in their spots first. There could still be hope for all of you internationals once the domestic round is over (the April 20 thing people on here have been receiving). They probably just want to put domestics in first! And then maybe a bunch of you will get off the waitlist. Hopefully this answers everyone‚Äôs questions.\n\n\nSource: https://news.ubc.ca/2017/08/28/ten-things-to-know-about-international-student-enrolment/\n\nP.S.

I'd like to note that personal profiles are actually highly important in the application process, probably more than we often think. Truth is, what may be a good/bad personal profile to someone may be a good/bad personal profile to the scorer. We really don't know how they're scored and what factors affect scoring....  See myth 3:\n\n>**Personal profiles are largely scored by alumni**, **who are at a fundamentally different place in life with a much different understanding of what is important and meaningful, and what is not**. What may seem like a killer EC for you (i.e. saving 100 puppies from Covid-19), will probably read like a poorly articulated attempt to pad your resume to anyone past their second year at UBC, while a minimum wage job delivering newspapers or helping your mom battle cancer\\*, may read as a genuine commitment to hard work, perseverance and investment in your community. (Note: Family responsibilities are considered a valid leadership activity)   \n>  \n>Your personal profile is scored based on how profound, exceptional and meaningful your accomplishments were, **especially in the context of your personal development and resiliency**. If your answers just list out various responsibilities you had while volunteering or brag about the non-profit you run, you have a bad personal profile. When you claim you had a great or terrible personal profile because of how many ECs you have, everyone here rolls their eyes, and either moves onto the next question or will call you out with this myth.\n\nAnd from myth 5:\n\n>there are way more factors than what you think your calculated GPA is, or how well you think you did on a personal profile question.\n\nOverall, if you are rejected from UBC, that doesn't really mean anything in the long run. There are still many options to get into UBC through external transfer processes. And if you're committed elsewhere, you can still have a fulfilling undergraduate experience. EDIT: wow first awards!!

I just gave advice to some student who reached out on the Sauder discord and I thought that I might as well pass on my advice to whoever wants to hear this. This advice is directed towards high school students applying to Sauder in particular tho. Funnily enough this was what I wanted when I was desperately scrolling through the UBC admissions megathread last year so this is my way of paying back to the community.\n\nHere\'s what I think (just know that everything I say is pure speculation, I ain\'t an admissions officer so yeah)\r  \nFirstly, let\'s just get some worries out of the way, don\'t panic, grade 11 grades aren\'t as important as you think there are, most of the time they are looking at grade 12 grades so I doubt it would make a big difference (if you are someone worrying about grade 11 grades)\r  \nSecondly,  you hear about grades being in like the 97%s and that\'s so wrong 92% is already really good and I want you to know that this is the honest truth and if you are anything like me, you probably will just be like ""ahahaha yeah right no way"" but hey we have all been there before. \n\nThird, here is a misconception on applying for early app, applying for early apps is always a good idea UNLESS you don\'t have enough time to write the whole thing. See it as fishing: if you stick out the rod now and you catch no fish, does that mean that you can\'t stick it out again and try again afterwards? That\'s precisely how uni application reviews work, if you don\'t get early app, just wait some longer and you will be reviewed for general admission. \n\n\r  \nWith that all aside, the question is what can you do? Well it\'s too late for you to change your courses to take GPA boosters (which i kinda did ahahaha) and it\'s not like you are going to reshape your life \rin two months, the reality is that now there isn\'t much drastic measures you can take but here is some small things you can do (and at the end of the day the small things add up:\n\n\r  \n1.Work hard in school, this should be obvious but really just spending 30 min studying a day makes all the difference, it adds up trust me\n\n\r  \n2. Really reflect on the level of your extra circulars, personally I was the vice president of my school‚Äôs business club and I had worked and done some other stuff at my local community center, try to get at least 5 of these but make sure you have at least two meaningful ones cause you have to write about them for one question\n\n\r  \n3.Write your app early, also seems simple enough but it‚Äôs super difficult. Everytime you write, you might feel unsatisfied with what you have written but just press on and keep writing. I had finished my first draft by early november and honestly it was terrible but here‚Äôs why you want to write it early:\n\n\r  \n4.Get people to check over it, doesn‚Äôt matter who get every to look over it but maybe counsellors, teachers, club leaders, and senior students in particular. They looked over my stuff and gave me advice on how to change it for the better, I ended up spending a solid month just editing and editing and editing and hey it worked out\n\n\r  \n5. Be proud in your writing and find meaning. Don‚Äôt be robotic and generic, alot of candidates can say they are a good student, but how many can say they are a meaningful one? When you write it, don\'t forget to reflect on what you have learned through your experiences and how it has changed you, I bet this is what UBC admissions officers want to see\n\n\r  \n6. Try not to panic or worry to much especially about the interview, everyone tells you this because it‚Äôs true, there‚Äôs so much to enjoy in grade 12 and worrying doesn‚Äôt help at all. Let me give you my personal experience with that: I personally bombed my interview I had stuttered a ton and all my points were circular as hell ( I had confidence in what I said tho, so try to have confidence in what you say as well). I freaked out harddd and honestly I was so worried but hey who knew that just two months later I would receive an acceptance. Problems look so big right in front of you but in retrospect I know it‚Äôs silly to have stressed so hard on stuff like that.\n\n\r  \nSo my concluding thoughts? Work hard and have fun, enjoy grade 12 cause this is your last year. Grades seem like they are so important now but remember that personal profile is equally as important ( I imagine a 40% personal profile 60% grade split), Sauder looks wayyyyy harder to get in than it actually is trust me, if not now then later on you will understand what I mean.

I think merit is the most important thing but merit is hard to calculate.\n\nLong answer: Merit isn‚Äôt always an X to X conversion. What‚Äôs more impressive: \n\nStudent A: parents pay for all their living expenses (on campus) so they can only focus on school getting a 90 in a course\n\nStudent B: works a part time job, helps take care of their siblings, and commutes an hour both ways getting an 80 in the course\n\nIt‚Äôs a difficult question to answer. On one hand Student A has shown they have a higher level of understanding of the materials. Student B however has shown the ability to keep up with the course while juggling personal responsibilities. As an employer I would likely hire B over A.\n\nSo how does this tie into Affirmative Action? Resources in the US (I‚Äôm American) are not evenly distributed across schools. Property tax rates determine your schools budget so wealthy areas schools have more resources. Looking at a demographic breakdown of the most disenfranchised neighborhoods often can be used to justify why AA is needed. I agree in concept that we need something to help account for the potential of students who might just be unlucky that their school and life does not allow them to focus on their studies. \n\nWhere I disagree is that this is racially based. It‚Äôs economic. A white kid and a black kid both going to the same shitty school in the bad part of town coming from identical family circumstances have access to the same resources. To me, it seems antithetical to the entire point of AA to give one of them special treatment but not the other. On the flip side, one of my best friends growing up was a black kid who‚Äôs dad was one of the most successful architects in my entire city. This kid was loaded, should he get special treatment just because of his race? I don‚Äôt think so, he had every advantage that I had in terms of resources. That is an X to X merit ratio. AA should be used to help those less fortunate than me and my friend compete with us, not competing against each other based on race.\n\nI think that some form of calculation should be taken into account looking at the school district and life circumstances of an individual. Potential for growth and learning is far more than just your high school grades. I just think this calculation should be based more on economic circumstances than racial ones.\n\nAlso socially I think racial/gender quotas lead to more hostile environments. For example, as a gay person I never mention that during an interview because I do not ever want to be like ‚Äúdid I get this job just because I‚Äôm gay?‚Äù I know I have girl friends who are in STEM say similar things.

The largest rise in genital herpes cases in recent years has been through the HSV1 strain. Mostly through oral sex (lips to genitals) it is believed. Just as HSV1 can cause cold sores and the gladitorum presentation, it also can be responsible for whitlow, ocular, encephalitis, and genital presentations.\n\nAnd though often milder at their non-prefered sites, painful lesions and resulting high outbreak transmissibility are hallmarks for both in the genital region.\n\nTreating one as significantly different from the other from a functional perspective is irrational - they are effectively the same disease with different preferences of established location. But their preferences do not stop them from establishing infection elsewhere.\n\nThe biggest difference may be that hsv 2 became an std boogieman in  70's sexual health awareness, whereas hsv 1 didn't.\n\nTo explain why is long and complicated, and a lot of it was political but not scientific. But there was never the kind of difference portrayed between them, as duly evidenced by modern genital cases of hsv 1 skyrocketing.\n\nThe irony here is that if you hsv1 orally, you are at actually at greater risk of giving it to your partner either orally or genitally (if you engage in oral sex), because genital to genital hsv1 transmission is less likely than oral to genital. So if you know you carry hsv1 orally, you are a greater risk to someone's sexual health than someone with hsv1 genitally. Either through giving it to them via oral sex, or giving it to them orally which they can then pass on to another partner.\n\nPlus there are increasing links between hsv1 and Alzheimer's.

**RELEVANT POINTS:**

* There are no testing sites on campus for *symptomatic* students. This means that students who are symptomatic need to get tested elsewhere (meaning a commute > extra spreading) or, if they want to avoid the hassle, just don‚Äôt get tested
   * \+ bonus points for the nearest testing site being at City Centre UPCC which is a 45 min transit away from campus (thanks u/kiwi_cloudpuff !)
   * What this means is that we don't actually know how many cases there are on campus. The only numbers we have are for those living in rez, but commuters are out of the picture + students who just arent getting tested because of the above reasons.
* The totem outbreak
* The vancouver senate still held their meeting over zoom, meanwhile exams of 100s of students are still taking place
* Public health  ([https://www.instagram.com/p/CXma7AlLrRZ/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CXma7AlLrRZ/)) now requires venues for events with 1000+ to be reduced to 50% capacity, no gatherings of more than 10 guests/another household + your household and yet exams are still happening cus logic i guess
* the stat200 final didn‚Äôt even have enough space for students to sit at desks, so there were students on the floor taking the exam (also a literal fire hazard for 2x kill combo)
* Lack of clarity and support for the cancelled GoGlobal exchange program students which was announced days before departure. International/exchange student travel is considered essential travel and yet students are not being permitted to go. (info from u/classicocodenames and more info available on ubcunspoken on ig \[[https://www.instagram.com/ubc\_unspoken/](https://www.instagram.com/ubc_unspoken/)\])
   * Students expecting to live in another country lose money to non-refundable rent in a home they won't live in. To be fair the risk was made clear from the start, but this means students who ended sublets/housing contracts must now scramble for a place to live with no support from the university
   * students are now unable to earn credits because they're not registered in anything leading to delayed grad. Especially troubling for upper year students with specific graduation prereqs that they may not be able to meet in time now.
   * UBC not permitting students to take the online alternatives for their classes even when the overseas school allows for it
* Just the great irony of the virology exam still being in person in OSB which is a 300ish person gym
   * Also the Faculty of \*\*science\*\* refusing to move exams online [https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/rk385y/faculty\_of\_science\_finally\_said\_something\_lol/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/rk385y/faculty_of_science_finally_said_something_lol/)

1607130648.0,Can Chemistry Change the World?,"In my final lecture for first-year chemistry this year, I presented a segment called 'Can Chemistry Change the World?' I discussed some of the ways that chemistry has, and continues to, reshape society and the planet, and some of the grand challenges that now face humanity as a result. I also describe how scientists are making great strides in developing clean energy, sustainable plastic, battery storage, and more.

The lecture was intended for an audience of first-year science students. My goals were to 1) showcase the exciting, impactful work that a career in chemistry can have, and 2) convince students that, despite the environmental doom-and-gloom we see every day in the media, that positive change is possible in the area of sustainability. Furthermore, UBC students are uniquely positioned to be catalysts for that change.

The majority of our first-year students enter UBC hoping to study medicine, and I have nothing but respect for those who eventually will. Through this lecture, however, I hoped to convey that the world values its scientists, and needs them more than ever.

Following [this thread about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/k5h4q5/dr_zach_hudson_gave_me_a_will_to_live/) I received many requests to make the lecture publicly available, and you may now find a link down below. Hope you like it.

[IRES](http://ires.ubc.ca/) and [the CERC](https://cerc.ubc.ca/) are two of these.

Most of these positions take place during the summer, though sometimes you can find availability during the regular term. When reaching out to a professor about a job, it's best to look at their lab website so that you understand what their research is about, and can comment on this in your initial email.

Based on that, it seems like this new goal of EO June is best case scenario, rather than ‚Äúworst case scenario‚Äù as you have put it.', ""Non-AMP Link: [https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/here-s-how-everyone-in-b-c-could-get-a-vaccine-shot-by-canada-day-1.5939602](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/here-s-how-everyone-in-b-c-could-get-a-vaccine-shot-by-canada-day-1.5939602)\n\nI'm a bot.

1702578000.0,I‚Äôve cheated on every exam at UBC,"Here‚Äôs how:

I show up to class right, I have a notebook on my lap where I write down what the professor is talking about! Every one else messes around on their laptops playing chess or scrolling through memes, I'm the only smart one because I'm copying what the prof says (Real sneaky so no one notices). Then, I look at these hand made notes for a few minutes everyday, increasing the time I look at them as I get closer to the test. I walk in, take the test (remembering everything the professor said!) and then walk out of there Mission Impossible style. It's almost impossible to get caught cheating this way. (secret)

Please don't snitch on me, I might get expelled.","[""I used to do something similar, except I'd take the notes and put them on littlecards and quiz myself.

1660286081.0,Tomorrow morning I'm asking the woman of my dreams to marry me. We met as first-year students at UBC in 2006.,"We met each other in our first year of university and have known each other for 16 years, and have been a couple for over 11 years. Through those 11 years we've done 4 years of long distance, 6 months apart/broken up, and have been living together consecutively for just over 4 years today. We've lived in 5 different cities (3 together, 2 while doing long distance) and 2 different countries (Canada and the US).

Like any good adventure, it hasn't always been the easiest journey, but I am so grateful for all of it. We both have grown and changed so much over these past 11 years and I am so excited to continue to grow together in love for the rest.


I'm asking her tomorrow morning in the rose garden at UBC after a nostalgic walk through campus. Wish me luck.","['Wish i would have such a love story to tell my kids one day.\n\nIm genuinly happy for you.
