1744763727.0,I walked from McMaster to UTSG (72km and 100k steps) in 16 hours and 45 minutes with almost no resting breaks during exam season,"I left my res at 11:45AM on Sunday (April 13) and arrived at New College by 4:30AM the following day (April 14). Upon departing, the estimated time of arrival was 15 hours and 45 minutes. My moving time ended up being 15 hours and 15 minutes, and the elapsed time was 16 hours and 45 minutes. I forgot to record on Strava upon exiting, so I hit start near MUSC and the parking lot at 11:49AM.

u/Vegetable-Anybody112 had been on my ass to replicate his[ journey from UofT to Mac](https://www.reddit.com/r/McMaster/comments/1gheive/i_walked_80km_and_107000_steps_to_mcmaster_from/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), but in reverse, for ages. After a ton of positive peer pressure and plotting, I figured it was now or never before the official end of my first year. My exam schedule was spaced out nicely with basically one exam a week, so this ended up working out, even last-minute.

I boldly told him that if I were to do it, unlike him, I'd do it without stopping. I grew up with a competitive nature and versatile athletic background until COVID rendered me a couch potato. But I did it. I walked from McMaster to UTSG (New College specifically): 72km and 100k steps in under 17 hours with hardly any real resting breaks, a step length ranging from 46‚Äì83 cm, and standing at just 5‚Äô1-5‚Äô2. Not once did I idle apart from when I had to at crosswalks and the final 1-hour stretch, where my body basically forced me to after I exhausted too much energy due to a bizarre situation.

My physical condition wasn‚Äôt at its peak either since I'd already done a string of late-night expeditions with others from April 1‚Äì4:[ Dundurn Stairs](https://www.reddit.com/r/McMaster/comments/1jowl0t/latenight_visit_to_dundurn_stairs_with_a_group/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button),[ Sam Lawrence Park](https://www.reddit.com/r/McMaster/comments/1jpp7ie/visit_to_sam_lawrence_park_turned_into_a_detoured/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), Cootes Paradise,[ Barton Street](https://www.reddit.com/r/McMaster/comments/1jrg1av/we_walked_down_the_entirety_of_barton_street/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and[ Devil‚Äôs Punchbowl](https://www.reddit.com/r/McMaster/comments/1jseksl/walking_from_devils_punchbowl_to_mac_a_night_full/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). My Converse's padding has wore down so bad that I could constantly feel my feet sinking. I packed a small bag that carried 3 water bottles (2 plastic and 1 reusable), 4 protein bars, 3 Kit Kats, a pouch of chargers, 2 power banks, IDs, toothbrush/paste, t-shirt, and some supplies. I packed accordingly so that I genuinely wouldn't need to spend a penny or stop elsewhere for any particular reason.

I had my first exam that ended at 10PM the day before, so I had dinner pretty late and made sure to get my hours in. Sunday was a warm and sunny day, around 15¬∞C, which are two conditions I don't quite enjoy. Yet there I was, ready to begin, on an empty stomach, wearing all black, a jacket, and cargo pants. I basically walked and texted for the first 4 hours. Then my battery started draining due to full brightness against the sun. Just as I was about to charge 5 hours in, my power bank failed me and I panicked. The power bank u/usedPOS graciously lent me a few days prior for the sake of this journey came in clutch. Thank you to u/Candid_Vast9388 and u/usedPOS for providing some oddly specific pics (may or may not have been feet and ass pics, respectively) as morale.

Early on, I had to pause briefly to figure out how to deal with the highway crossings, but in total, I only took 2‚Äì3 legitimate breaks near the very end. I had my first sip of water 5 hours in. My first protein bar at 6 hours and first Kit Kat at 8 hours. My first and last washroom stop was 12 hours in at an A&W in Toronto. And my first official break was less than 1 hour away from the destination.¬†

I shared my location with my friends, u/Candid_Vast9388 and u/Vegetable-Anybody112, who were impressed and commented that I was initially blazing through it all. I was averaging 10km in \~2 hours. I hit 40km in \~8.5 hours of non-stop walking, holding a steady pace of 4-5.50km/h. But after the 9-hour mark, the crash began to creep in ever so slightly. From there onward, grass and dirt became my best friends whenever I could locate any. Touching grass had never felt more euphoric. I reached the ""Welcome to Toronto"" sign in 11.5 hours. My time in Toronto and the final hour to UTSG, though, were absolute hell, especially since I couldn't locate any patches of grass or dirt and stubbornly limped across the sidewalk. Needless to say, this truly pushed my limits, and I went through a turbulent emotional roller coaster ride.","['The ""I\'ll do anything but study"" award goes to', 'are you okay?

1731859837.0,"I walked for 76 kilometers(and bussed 40 kilometers) from UofTSG to uWaterloo, with 2 strangers from the internet","This was quite the adventure. I walked to McMaster in October and posted that walk on this subreddit, I promised that I'd walk to uWaterloo, so here it is.

I made a post on here asking if anybody wanted to join in on the walk to uWaterloo, and two amazing people, complete internet strangers, responded to that post and we walked to Waterloo, for nearly 24 hours straight, together. As a group we were able to motivate each other by chatting, making jokes, setting reasonable expectations and goals, and overall I felt like this walk was more enjoyable than my solo walk to McMaster because of this company.

We met up at around 9:40AM. Initially, we had wanted to walk to Brampton and walk the 40 kilometers of highway connecting the GTA and Guelph. We arrived in Brampton at 8 PM (after 11 hours of walking) but decided not to walk this highway since it was dark, we weren‚Äôt sure if there were sufficinently large gravel shoulders to walk on, safety and time constraints. Instead we bussed from Brampton to Guelph University (at 10pm). After that we trudged on to Waterloo. 

We arrived at the outskirts of Guelph at 1:20AM and walked through a wide expanse of highway for 3 hours before arriving af Breslau at 4:30AM. We got to Kitchener at 5:00 and we arrived at Wilfrid Laurier University at 8:00. After an hour‚Äôs break to recover, we finally got to our destination of uWaterloo at 10:00. 

Unfortunately because of my lack of research I didn‚Äôt know that the bookstores in uGuelph, WLU and uWaterloo were all closed until about 10 hours into the walk, I really wanted to purchase some hoodies to commemorate

Why are the final exam grades so low?\n\nThe course instructors have never seen an exam average so low. We reflected deeply on possible causes of this. In particular: did we create a fair exam and whether the grading was appropriate.\n\n* The multiple choice questions were mostly direct questions involving core objects in the course (polynomials, matrices, derivative operator).\n* Some multiple choice questions were at the level of quiz questions.\n* The computations were kept short, with simple numbers.\n* The exam was heavier on theory than computation, but this reflects how the written assignments were focused on theory.\n* 49 students got 0 or 1 points on Long Answer Q1.\n* Two points were given for correctly stating the conditions needed for the principal axes theorem.\n* This is a very important theorem in the course, examined multiple times in the course.\n* 63 students got 0,1 or 2 points on Long Answer Q2.\n* 3 points were given for citing results from Written Assignment 4, without proof.\n* We expected students to have spent time completing Written Assignment 4, and then we asked you to review your assignments in the final exam info.\n\nWe largely believe that the exam was fair, and that the course materials (slides, tutorials, quizzes, and assignments) set students up for success.\n\nThat being said, our expectations for complete solutions on the long answers were too high, and we awarded some bonus points to make up some of the difference (see next section for an explanation).\n\n## 3. How were final grades calculated? Was there any curving/rounding?\n\nTwo adjustments were made to the final grades:\n\n* **Up to 4 bonus points were awarded on the long answer questions of the exam**. On every long answer question, if you got at least 1 point on that question, you were given a bonus point. Since there were 4 long answer questions, you could receive up to 4 bonus points.\n* This method was chosen to reward people who made some progress on the long answer questions.\n* [REDACTED - this part is about an error in the final grade calculations which is no longer relevant]\n\nAll final grades were rounded up to the nearest integer.\n\nFor example, a final grade of 67.01 was rounded up to an 68."", 'I second that', '4thed and I don‚Äôt even go here.

This result was surprising, and saddening.\n2. The exam was not designed to ""bring down the average"" or anything like that.\n3. Multiple instructors/TAs (some outside the course) reviewed the exam and deemed it fair.\n4. I and the other instructors will spend more time reflecting on what we as instructors can do.\n5. I\'ve run this course structure in this course multiple times pre-pandemic, and during lockdown; this result is a large outlier.\n\n## Details about the course\n\n* The course is a pretty standard second course in Linear algebra.\n* It\'s taught in a ""half-lecture with short in class activities"" style.\n* Slides are given out, and the class is recorded.\n* There are bi-weekly assignments, worth 30% (only count 5 of 6)\n* There are weekly ""simple"" quizzes after tutorials worth 30%. (Intended to be 30 min but you have 24 hours, asynchronous, only count 10 of 11). These are designed to help you see if you\'re on track.\n* Final exam worth 40%\n\nIn particular, no midterm, but we give them an optional practice midterm.\n\nThe idea here is to promote and encourage good habits and reflection, without the added stress of a test. Tests don\'t work great for Linear Algebra 2 because it is a theory heavy course that requires deep thinking. Assignments are much better for this.\n\n## How did the quizzes and assignments go?\n\nGenerally the assignments went well, although they required a lot of thinking, and grappling with ideas.\n\nOne of the key goals in this course is for students to develop their own models for understanding vector spaces, bases, subspaces, and transformations. This takes time, effort, and honesty.\n\nThe quizzes were very well done. I suspect that many students did not take the self-assessment parts of it seriously.\n\nWe asked them to give their confidence on each question (see [Sorensen-Unruh](https://clarissasorensenunruh.com/2019/05/01/ungrading-the-first-exam-part-3/) or [Tao](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2016/06/01/how-to-assign-partial-credit-on-an-exam-of-true-false-questions/) for examples) and then told them how to address low confidence (ask questions, office hours, piazza, attend class, tutorials, math learning centre).\n\n## Walking the path of destruction\n\nA student in another one of my classes said ""you let us walk down the path of destruction if we want"".\n\nI give students the tools to succeed as best I can. For most people, coming to class and tutorials and actively participating would have been enough to do *fine* on the exam. (In fact, most people who attended the classes and tutorial did do fine!)\n\nBut many didn\'t, and chose to walk the path of destruction.\n\nSo be it.\n\nIt\'s sad to see.\n\nI reached my hand out to you.\n\nAs you got pulled into the abyss.\n\nI need to stare into it.\n\nIt\'s beautiful.\n\nAnd dark.\n\nAnd lovely.\n\nAnd cold.\n\nAnd scary\n\nAnd as I scream into it, my voice chokes in my throat.\n\nI\'ve fallen \n\nAnd I\'m caught by the earth\n\nHolding me up\n\nCovered in snow\n\nI feel the heat of my cheeks\n\nMelting\n\nFreezing\n\nMelting\n\nFreezing\n\nI break apart rock', 'My chem 100 class average was 21% at UBC.

In classrooms, many international students speak their own languages, which sometimes creates a barrier for others, myself included.

I often feel like I'm wasting my time in classes.

I used to love engaging with other students in classes and tutorials - that was one of my favourite parts of university - but now it‚Äôs not the same. It's like I've somehow gotten lost on my way to class and ended up in an ESL lesson instead of a UofT classroom, and I'm absolutely bored.

I‚Äôve also noticed that extracurriculars aren‚Äôt as accessible because of language issues.

Pride will always be about queer people first, sure we can have other groups join but they shouldn‚Äôt be the center of pride. Pride is really important for a lot of queer people and taking that away isn‚Äôt going to help anyone. \n\nNow, if the issue is PrideTO, how come I‚Äôve never heard of them funding genocide? Why hasn‚Äôt anyone organized their own pride separated from PrideTO? If they did, when was it and how come I never heard about it? \n\nThere is so much that could have been done instead of stopping pride, making mad people who already support Palestine isn‚Äôt going to help stop the genocide.', 'Yeah. Bored now. \n\nConsider that all of the pro-Palestine movements have been curtailed and are in the process of being removed. The movement vastly misunderstands the leavers of power in this nation and has made zero inroads with movements that could have supported them. Then they pissed off the larger gay community who have a lot of power in the various protest movements. Slapping the hands of people who might have helped you is a fantastic way to fail. These movements will be forgotten in a couple of months. Pride will endure. \n\nI say again. Grow up.', 'They are led by a career shit disturber who chose to disrupt Pride because he didn‚Äôt get what he wanted. \n\nThe current form of Pride attracts literally millions of people to support our community. It draws in open support from politicians of many stripes, people of nearly every ethnicity, people of nearly every religion. The ‚Äúgrassroots‚Äù movements that these hero‚Äôs wish to return back to cannot claim the same, and they were nearly always dominated by white cis-folk. Pride Toronto also draws in a huge degree support from corporations (yes, they are part of Pride as well), and it is justifiable a celebration of our long-fought and ever-at-risk freedom. If corporations wish to fund it so that it can be open to everyone, so be it. \n\nPalestine is, at best, a peripheral issue to the LGBTQ movement in Canada. There are significantly more important and pressing issues to Canada‚Äôs LGBTQ community that deserve significantly more attention than No Pride in Genocide unjustly seized. \n\nI have already agreed in other comments that a grassroots parade would be nice, and it does in fact exist in some of the side parades that occur over the weekend.  However, we are no longer in the 80s and we have ‚Äúwon,‚Äù whatever that means. That means we can celebrate, and protest, together. That doesn‚Äôt mean that one group EVER has the right to try to speak for us all or to derail the right for all of us to speak if we so choose. \n\nThis is why I‚Äôm specifically furious with No Pride in Genocide, and BLM peripherally, for the use of this tactic. It is a tactic of silencing others who also have the right to speak. It is the equivalent of yelling so loud that no one else can be heard. That is adamantly NOT what Pride, or even a community, is about. That is what our oppressors do to us.\n\nI have sat on several Pride committees in my years. I have dealt with many people like him.

His personal feelings aren‚Äôt really my concern. His points are that Pride is willing to bend its progressive and activist roots for the sake of not angering its corporate sponsors.

(got mine on amazon)\n* **Invest in a electric brush**, they clean so much better than a manual one, and faster too (used to have a lot cavities as a kid, but as soon as I got the electric my teeth improved significantly)\n* **Brush twice day**, first in the morning (before or after breakfast, doesn't matter imo, just as long as you actually do it) and before you go to bed.\n* **FLOSS!** gets rid of all that nasty plaque and old food that you would not be able to get with just brushing. You can either use floss picks or just the regular string kind, the floss picks are easier for me but I've heard that the regular one is better for your teeth.\n* **Use mouthwash** after brushing teeth for 30 secs to 1 min\n* **Change underwear and socks daily**, t shirts and bras after 2 uses, and pants after 3-4.\n   * however if the t-shirt/pant is smelly just after one use, wear another one\n* **Shower daily and use a washable wash cloth to get rid of dead skin cells** (use a new wash cloth for every shower, you can find them amazon)\n* **AHA/BHA cleansers for armpits reduces odor**\n* If you live in a dorm, please **air your dorm out,** smells marinate in there\n* **Don't keep clean clothes in the same space you are cooking in**\n* **Wash bed sheets weekly or bi weekly, pillow cases and bath towels every week** (also hang your towels to airdry after every use, prevents mold buildup)\n* **Use only 1/4 cup of laundry detergent and do not overload machine**\n* **Use a neutral soap like dove on your vulva**. Just warm water is fine for cleaning the vaginal opening\n* Don't have a penis but I'm pretty sure if you have **foreskin** your supposed to **pull that shit back and wash**\n* **!!!!USE DEORDRANT!!!!!** if you want to smell fresh, but don‚Äôt have a problem with sweat. Use anti perspirant if you want to fight both sweat and smell.\n\nThis is honestly all I could think of at the moment, hopefully those in MAT137 can follow these tips so I don't need to upgrade to a gas mask for Thursday's lecture"", 'This is so fucking funny to me.

There's a lot more platforms to get used to for assessments compared to CHM135 or BIO120, where everything is standardized on Quercus and simple. I myself have yet to encounter technical difficulties, but it's way scarier to print off math quizzes and have to scan it again compared to, say, a bio test where I just type my ideas into boxes.\n\n2) There is no room for student input\n\nThe staff refuse to acknowledge any possibility that the TA's marking was faulty. Most of the time the marking is ok. However, on a recent quiz many students wrote extremely similar answers (the question wasn't too hard) but received different marks. The course policies have made it impossible to contest marks at all; if you try to ask for a regrade, even with good justification, they'll just take off more marks for you being a nuisance. This shuts down any opposition. Consider BIO120 and CHM135, where they take the time to consider all regrade requests. I know many people have gotten regrades for the most recent bio test because they thought they deserved more marks.

It's a zero-sum game though; if one prof gets a large slice another prof must get a small one.  This has a significant effect on the classes that faculty choose to teach (if they're chasing $$, that is).\n\nMost departments judge the files on a 4-4-2 basis (research:teaching:admin) although different departments can have different balances.  The teaching portion can be affected by course evaluations --- this is up to the department.  The teaching portion is rarely *determined* by course evaluations.\n\nNo-one ever gets a negative slice of pie; no-one's salary is decreased as a result of this process.   Faculty do have their salaries decrease when they go on sabbatical.

You mentioned people from the diaspora returning home. Palestine being given to WWII survivors was a random act by European powers (Balfour Declaration) because the US and Europe didn‚Äôt want Jewish refugees.

If by ‚ÄúGaza‚Äù you mean Hamas, the ultra simplified answer is that they found themselves between a rock and a hard place  both politically and existentially, and it was the best bad move they had. Hamas has been moving slowly toward more diplomatic relations with the Israeli government since releasing their newer, softer charter six years ago, while right wing, Anti Palestinian sentiment within Israel grew (the rock). Unfortunately, playing nice(er) also led directly to them losing some of their Islamic Revolutionary bona fides with more hardline Palestinians, which is important enough that it started to call their legitimacy as representatives of Gazans writ large into question (the hard place). Add to this that Hamas‚Äô biggest ally, Iran, found itself in a very difficult position politically thanks to their (very unpopular) support of Syria and the normalization of relations between Israel and the Saudis. \n\nThe October 7th attacks did a few things to ease some of this pressure on Hamas:\n\n-Hamas regained some popular support with Gazans. Many Gazans don‚Äôt like Hamas, but when the Israeli counterattack does not often draw a firm distinction between the two groups, the issue becomes existential for them as individuals. Do you support the invading military trying to kill you and your loved ones, or the people fighting them? Easy answer for most people, whether or not they share the defenders‚Äô politics. \n\n-This also strengthens Hamas‚Äô claim to the leadership of the Palestinian nationalist movement, and not just in Gaza. Israel‚Äôs brutal, indiscriminate response has undermined the moral position of the softer-line Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, which now lets Hamas set the agenda. \n\n-Israel‚Äôs response has become the most important ongoing event in the region, distracting Iran‚Äôs neighbours from their support of Syria. It also killed any talk of Israel-Saudi normalization. All of this is good news for Hamas‚Äôs biggest financial supporter. \n\nSo to answer the question, the end goal is basically what has already happened and is happening‚Äîassuming Israel is unsuccessful in eliminating Hamas outright. They would have known this was a risk, of course, but given the position they (and Gazans as a whole) were in,it seems as though it was one they felt they had to take.', ""It was a last ditch attempt, they saw the signs with the third temple and red heifers.

But writing superficially convincing or even logically consistent arguments, although a good skill to have, is worthless without good data and a strong understanding of it. Humanities and social sciences have students writing essays from day one. They get very good at writing convincingly, but that's something very different from sound argumentation.\n\nThe value of STEM education is demonstrated in the typical non-STEM grad studies track. After four years of undergrad, many of those that go on to grad studies start taking introductory math and stats classes on the level of what first year STEM students take (social sciences more so than humanities). Some honours undergrads may take intro stats, but they aren't exposed to rigorous math with proofs. They also have to catch up on that in grad school. The method of teaching is completely ass backwards. Instead of first learning the tools to truly understand the world and provide actual evidence for their arguments, they spend all their time arguing based on little more than foregone conclusions and cherry-picked citations. Then if they decide to get serious about it, they have to go back and learn what STEM majors did in undergrad.\n\nAssuming you're a STEM major, I don't understand how you think you're just learning to regurgitate. You're learning what others have done and proven before you. You're learning how the foundations of repeatable and testable science were built. You're learning how logical, provable results were obtained. You're learning the closest thing we have to objective truth and understanding of the world. You don't think that formulating logical arguments and communicating them clearly is part and parcel of that? STEM undergrad actually prepares you for scientific research (in principle, depending on how seriously you take your studies). Before you start formulating your own hypotheses and making your own arguments, you spend four years learning how other people did it before you. From the perspective of teaching sound and rigorous argumentation, it's a much better method than writing vapid essays about stuff you can't prove one way or another."", ""Ignore the haters man. Seriously impressive trajectory based on where you started. Couldn't have been easy. You put the work in and it shows!"", 'Sorry for asking?\xa0', 'I struggle to understand what you mean by serious. I think there is room to criticize the scope of some of these courses but I‚Äôm not sure how you would go about grading students fairly without relying on coherency and writing quality. \n\nI‚Äôd also have trouble accepting any particular answer as ‚Äúright‚Äù or knowable in many of the topics discussed. A lot of papers may start with some conclusion because you can‚Äôt be correct about race or gender for example, so you need a premise or framework to build upon. \n\nAlso a lot of people take humanities courses to prep for politics or law, being convincing is kinda the whole deal.', '""sex in the city""\n\nmaybe if you were a porn broker', ""I honestly don't know if undergrad preps students for research. This is kind of what I'm saying, I think humanities is actually better prep for future research. \n\nAgain, it's just my take. Undergrad just felt pretty stupid, I just learn something and regurgitate. When I teach courses with an essay portion, just the absolute trash I get from science students is unfathomable. This is why I think there is something wrong with the pedagogy of undergrad science. \n\nAnyways, I think I held similar views to you before I started my doctorate. However, I think a lot of my experiences challenged my beliefs, and I guess I'm much more fluid about my views on academia now. The world of scientific publications isn't what I thought it would be ...\n\nAlso which fields are you specifically talking about? Humanities fields like linguistics, philosophy, can be quite rigorous."", 'i wasn‚Äôt offended at all, i was just clarifying', ""For one thing, most research in social sciences like psychology, linguistics, economics, and even sociology and political science to an extent, involves rigorous math and statistics, which is not taught at the undergrad level in those fields save for an intro stats class (with economics being a partial exception, depending on the program). So in pretty real terms, if you aren't competent in stats, you don't have the knowledge to comment on, much less the authority to form opinions on contemporary research.\n\nBy serious I also mean doing a real literature review and gaining a reasonable understanding of the relevant domain *before* starting to write essays or papers. This is what I think STEM curricula get exactly right: you spend four years learning the domain in undergrad with very little writing papers or essays because you don't actually know shit yet, so why write a useless essay about something you know very little about? After building a solid foundation in the relevant theory and practices, you start to form your own hypotheses and arguments in grad school.\n\nHumanities and social sciences seem to do this exactly ass backwards, you spend four years arguing from a position of ignorance, and then if you decide to go to grad studies you have to learn from scratch how to understand and formulate scientifically rigorous arguments.\n\n>I‚Äôd also have trouble accepting any particular answer as ‚Äúright‚Äù or knowable in many of the topics discussed.\n\nThis may simply be a lack of knowledge on experiment design. It's very difficult to make a positive statement about the world or humanity that doesn't motivate a falsifiable experiment. If you aren't able to come up with experiments to support claims you make about race and gender, that doesn't mean such experiments don't or couldn't exist, it just means you don't know about them. And to conduct them, you need math, there's no two ways about it."", ""Getting trash essays from science undergrads is one thing, but I've read absolute garbage papers published in geography, philosophy and sociology journals demonstrating a shockingly amateurish understanding of statistics, among other things. And yes I've read poorly written CS papers, but I've yet to read one that makes me question whether the authors got anything more than a C in intro stats (and whether they could still pass the final exam in that course). I'm not nearly as concerned about that as I am about a team of geography PhDs making lofty claims based on nothing more than arithmetic means of dirty datasets, and getting published in a peer-reviewed journal. No wonder there's a replication crisis in the social sciences.\n\nSome social sciences are very rigorous, linguistics being one of them, economics being another. I minored in the latter and have friends in the former. In spite of how rigorous these fields are at the grad level, there's a world of difference between the way they're taught in undergrad vs STEM fields. And it makes absolutely no sense to me.\n\nAs for philosophy, if you remove logic, which I don't think philosophy can claim any more than it can physics or zoology, or any other science that was once nominally philosophy, then I don't see it as a particularly rigorous humanity."", 'Sorry. I always thought ofc means ‚Äúof F-ing course ‚Äú. I just googled it.\xa0', ""I can agree broadly that many courses seem light on math and statistics but I still think writing papers is a viable way to grade for comprehension of the readings. Otherwise undergrads would just have to memorize the background material and regurgitate quotes on a test which I can't imagine being very effective (though I recognize I'm talking out of my ass a bit here).\n\nI think this works better for STEM because reproducing a proof or repeating computations can actually reinforce your understanding. I think of writing an essay as an exercise where you have the opportunity to integrate the theories taught in class into your arguments so you can be better acquainted with them, not necessarily an exercise in finding the capital T 'Truth'.\n\nI also think you aren't acknowledging that many of the Arts simply do not, by definition, have right answers. You cannot design an experiment that solves a philosophical quandary or attributes meaning to art. You can form some semblance of consensus certainly, but if you're studying avant-garde cinemas or performance art there is no objective truth to measure. That's what I was attempting to get at when I mentioned race and gender.\n\nThere are certainly things that can be measured or tested for like differences in socioeconomic outcomes, biases, values etc. but there are also more subjective objects of study that cannot be as easily measured.\n\nI'm now noticing that I think we may just be talking about completely different types of courses. I think a more data driven approach makes sense for the fields you mentioned (psychology, economics, sociology) but it's less relevant when discussing things such as English, Arts History, or Book and Media Studies. This is where I have to admit I just get salty when people flippantly dismiss these more subjective fields because they are less scientific, as if they can't present any sort of value outside of that."", 'Ofc to me means of course.', 'ts (this) pmo', 'Yes.

Much of my post history in the past couple of months has been around landlord and tenant laws, and this comment reflects this sentiment to the bone. Obviously OP\'s situation is not ideal - now there\'s some guy living in the place when it was communicated it was just 3 people. It\'s happened to me too. I\'ve lived in 4-5 bedroom apartments where there were 8 people or more. But there is no way OP can get out of this through any enforced measures. Anything to limit guests or to rebalance the rent would require consent from the roommate and can be rescinded at any time, which OP has already tried and it hasn\'t worked. Any more discussion would be moving towards harassment, which could implicate OP. In short, their best avenue forward is to either tank it, or to move out.\n\nTo the comments suggesting a rental increase, having the Landlord enforce something, or trying to evict for interference - this is incredibly poor advice and would put OP in a worse place than if they just tanked it. An eviction for interference of reasonable enjoyment generally requires multiple N5 notices, corroborated with police reports, bylaw visits, and signed testaments from neighbors or roommates as well as a 8-12 month wait for a LTB hearing. Without such, an eviction would not succeed. For the reasons OP is providing, the LTB could even view it as a bad-faith eviction as they are evicting another tenant for attempting to exercise their right to have guests.\n\n**EDIT 2:** Wow this has blown up huge overnight. There\'s been a lot of comments on the ethics and morality of the issue and I get it, it\'s not an ideal situation. There are also plenty of comments on the lease saying no guests, or comments on their local tenancy laws or how it works where they are, which aren\'t really suitable for Ontario tenancy advice. I\'ve addressed some of these comments piecemeal through the post, but I\'ll add them here to specify the Ontario laws around these issues:\n\nUnder Ontario Law, any provision, clause, or agreement with respect to a tenancy that contradicts or limits a tenant\'s rights under the Residential Tenancies Act is null and void. In layperson\'s terms, a tenant cannot ""sign away"" their rights under a private lease or agreement.\n\n**Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, S.O. 2006, c. 17, https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/06r17** \n\n> Provisions conflicting with Act void: 4 (1) Subject to subsection 12.1 (11) and section 194, a provision in a tenancy agreement that is inconsistent with this Act or the regulations is void. 2006, c. 17, s. 4; 2017, c. 13, s. 1.\n\n**[Ontario Standard Lease](https://www.forms.ssb.gov.on.ca/mbs/ssb/forms/ssbforms.nsf/FormDetail?OpenForm&ACT=RDR&TAB=PROFILE&SRCH&ENV=WWE&TIT=2229E&NO=047-2229E)**\n\n> This tenancy agreement (or lease) is required for tenancies entered into on April 30, 2018 or later\n\n> (Section Q): The landlord cannot stop tenants from having guests, require the tenant to notify the landlord or get the landlord\'s permission before having guests. The landlord cannot charge extra fees or raise the rent due to guests in the rental unit.\n\n> (Page 6) If a term conflicts with the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 or any other terms set out in this form, the term is void (not valid or legally binding) and it cannot be enforced. Some examples of void and unenforceable terms include those that: ... Do not allow guests, roommates, any additional occupants\n\nThere are also some specific rules around standard leases that are summarized as: even if you don\'t have a standard lease, you are protected by the provisions of the standard lease. You can request for a standard lease, and within 21 days they must provide one or you can withhold 1 month of rent, within 30 days after that if one is not provided, you can keep that 1 month of rent, and some provisions for ending a tenancy early if not provided with a SL.

Things only get violent when cops show up after admin calls them to bail them out.', 'Lmao y‚Äôall are saying totally opposite things during the HK protest', 'Lol ""destruction of property"" is not the same thing as pushing a woman down concrete stairs and ripping Muslim women\'s hijabs off their heads while they cry for help. Also it\'s been PROVEN through many outlets that counterprotestors shouted the antisemitic slogans to make the peaceful pro-Palestine protest look bad. Common tactic actually - a few months ago at UBC it was also uncovered that a Zionist group was behind some anti-semitic stickers posted on campus.', 'Moron has a problem with ‚Äúviolence‚Äù in the form of anti war protesters trashing a building, but has no problem with the most densely populated piece of land being levelled to the ground by israeli nazis killing 25,000 (that just accounts the women and children) Palestinians.', 'Honestly!

I agree. \n\nFor the first point, I tried to figure out the difference between the two. The conclusion I landed on from other articles and discussions online is both are being used interchangeably. It‚Äôs really hard to quantify exactly how a company is ‚Äúsustaining the Israel-Palestine apartheid‚Äù. There are some very direct examples like military companies that might be supplying weapons or construction firms based on Israel that are building in Palestine for the purposes of expanding Israeli influence. That is direct involvement. But how far are we really measuring this. Like the other person commented the list of companies, or the same list is being circulated online. Is now selling soap in Israel constitute as direct involvement in this conflict? Or is it every tax paying person or entity in Israel is being held accountable too? \n\nI don‚Äôt know the answer to the above.', 'My understanding is that part of their demands were that UofT ""disclose all investments held in endowments, short-term working capital assets, and other financial holdings of the university"" and thus far this demand has been refused.', 'So then you want UofT to divest of Israeli companies?

Workers being locked inside their employers homes and closets so they can\'t escape or call for help. The government there isn\'t just aware they\'ve been complicit, with specific zoning laws and police patrols meant to fence in these workers before the world cup. \n\nAn employer who steals your identification, doesn\'t let you move around the city freely, controls where you *must* live, deducting random amounts of money from pay under the guise of ""paying for rent and food"" (they have no other options) and forcing them to work in insanely hot conditions causing severe heat stroke without water or breaks, all of that absolutely meets the modern definition of slavery.', 'Yeah because hamas are a bunch of pxssies n use them as shields.

This is why students from small schools don\'t get into UofT for graduate school. You can tell from looking at the course averages that the grades are inflated like they would be for college level courses.\n\nEvery research school has a way of making your grades equivalent to what students in those courses would receive.\n\nFrom ([https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/sites/default/files/import-files/grading8958.pdf](https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/sites/default/files/import-files/grading8958.pdf))\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe professor is not doing his/her students\' any favours by inflating his/her grades. His class sounds like it was not challenging enough for students . \n\nThis professor sounds like he belongs in a liberal arts school, not a conservative research school, like UofT. It\'s certainly a bad fit for him. \n\nI taught at UofT and full-time at multiple liberal arts schools. \n\nIt was so stressful at UofT to make sure your averages were not too high. The chair made it very clear that the average grade requirement for their required courses at the second-year level should be between 68% and 72%.\n\nI was so used to UofTs grading criteria, nearly half of my students failed intro stats the first time I taught it at a liberal arts school. I made the exams very challenging for the UofT students (they really had to think to be able to answer the questions) and a good chunk still did exceptionally well. I tried to use the same exam at a liberal arts school (without naming any names!) and over half the students failed the same exam.\n\nIf you want a degree from a research school like UofT, you need to work for it. The purpose of your degree is to be challenged and not to be ""buddies"" with your instructor. The instructor should be mentoring you.\n\nThe way the instructor spoke to his class is what you would expect from a professor at a liberal arts school. Your classes are small. You are encouraged to be friends with your instructor in a manner that would be considered unprofessional elsewhere. It\'s a culture shock to see what instructors say to students via email and can get away with in liberal arts schools. That instructor will not have a job at UofT after his reaction to a grading policy. \n\nThe chair will likely file a harassment complaint against him/her, because the chair is probably following university policy and procedures, while the instructor is in total violation on all of them.\n\nThe university administration will always side with the chair and it sounds like this professors grades are outside what is required at UofT. UofT has a very strict policy about grades and grade distributions. Liberal arts schools, in my experience, don\'t have any grade requirements.\n\n\\*\\*\n\n**3.3. Adjustment of final grades**\n\nThe final grades recommended by the instructor in an undergraduate or graduate course should not normally be adjusted except where the Chair, Dean or Dean‚Äôs designate judge that the consequences of allowing the grades to stand would be injurious to the standards of the University, or are not in keeping with divisional grading guidelines. Any adjustment of final grades should be made in consultation with the instructor. Divisional review processes may rely on past statistical data, including drop‚Äêout rates, mean arithmetic average, etc. as background information where available; however, this information should not be relied upon exclusively to judge whether a specific grade distribution is anomalous. Rather, the information should provide part of the basis for an overall review of grades in a division.\n\n**3.4. Considerations in the review and approval of final grades**\n\n3.4.1. Conformity with Policy\n\nFor undergraduate and graduate courses, the fundamental criterion that any divisional/faculty final grade review process should employ is whether the instructor has followed this Assessment and Grading Practices Policy.\n\n3.4.2. Distribution of grades\n\nThe distribution of grades in any course, examination or other academic assessment must not be predetermined by any system of quotas that specifies the number or percentage of grades allowable at any grade level. However, a division/faculty may provide guidelines to instructors setting out a reasonable distribution of grades in the division or department. The division may request an explanation of any grades for a course that appear not to meet divisional guidelines, are not based on the approved grade scales, or otherwise appear anomalous in reference to the Policy. It is understood that this section will normally only be used when the class size is thirty students or greater.\n\n**3.5. Informing instructors and students of grade adjustment**\n\nFor undergraduate and graduate courses where grades have been adjusted, by the Chair, Dean, or Dean‚Äôs designate, the Chair, Dean or Dean‚Äôs designate should ensure that the instructor as well as the students are informed. On request, the students or the instructor will be given the reason for the adjustment of grades and a description of the methodology used to adjust the grades. Students will be given a description of the divisional appeal process.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nDisclaimer: These are the impressions I am getting. I am not in that class nor claim to know what went on. The professor could be a victim of academic mobbing and the chair could be bullying and taunting him. The chair could also be abusing his/her own power, because he feels threatened by the junior faculty member & maybe the junior faculty member is having a mental breakdown from taking the abuse and having his/her actions constantly questioned.\n\nI know from personal experience, I was in a very toxic department at one point. I complained to the administration about the chair and they did nothing to help me, even though I had a PhD from the top research school in Canada, a much better scholarly record, was invited to give talks at top universities (paid for by those universities), and had good course evaluations. This chair had no publications, no scholarly record, a PhD from an average school, and no one knew of her to invite her to give a talk. She had no research and was/is in her 50s. She was twice my age and wanted to show how much power she had over me. She would meet with me over things like writing one 12am email to students, when I taught class until 10pm the same night, thereby wasting my time.\n\nShe got away with so many abusive actions against me that were in total violation of labour laws and federal legislation. I was fresh out of graduate school and totally powerless. I could not even get the institution\'s administration to respect me. I remember writing an email to students I regretted after she put me into a corner and the administration refused to help. The email was nothing like the one above, but it was unprofessional nonetheless. I asked students to talk to the dean for me and apparently the first-year students parents called the dean that entire morning, as the students were so traumatized that I was not going to teach their class because of the chair. \n\nI was put on an administrative leave for the remainder of my contract and had my university email account suspended. The instructor will regret having sent this email. He created a mess for the administration to clean up. I have been there and done that. For certain, his email account is probably already suspended. Note, if your instructor\'s email account is suspended, you will NOT know as there is no ""bounce back."" The account still exists, but your instructor can no longer read his/her emails nor respond to them.\n\nIt has not affected my employment chances, as of yet; I was short-listed for every other job I applied for. The faculty at that institution hate me and have not spoken to me since. I have to hope no employer will EVER care to hear from them. I am still ashamed about my actions of disclosing confidential information to students and hope to never see any of those students again. Since I had no prospects for future employment at that school, due to the chair\'s detest for me and administration\'s refusal to help, I did not consider how my actions would affect my students. \n\nPersonally, he should have asked the chair or a colleague about UofTs grade requirements. Liberal arts (primarily undergraduate) institutions begin you at 100%.

The result is that your alumni are more competitive for grad school and top jobs in industry, which in turn helps bolster your reputation, results in more donations down the line, etc. It\'s noble that Uoft (and other schools) don\'t succumb to grade inflation pressure...but it absolutely hurts the institution itself in the long run.', ""For a grade distribution of a course, it's not so much the teaching as it is the assessment."", 'Like a multi layered sandwich of mistakes.', 'Like?', '[removed]', ""Ah.

But overall, agree.\n\nThe upside of inflating grades - eh. I mean, by comparison to US schools, it sure makes sense. If you\'re trying to get an internship or a job at a US company, and they care about GPA (as ""competitive GPA"" which is what they normally put), those companies couldn\'t care less that you have a 3.2 average when the class average is 1.7. They prefer the 3.7 average when the class average is 3.9, because they\'re not going to bother with class averages. 3.7 sounds more competitive than 3.2.\n\nBut I do think it devalues the idea of education. If the minimum grade you can get is 3.5 GPA, then what\'s the point of grades? Go with pass/fail, it\'s the same thing. I sort of resent the American schools that perpetuate this.

The entire point is to make grads look better on paper for companies to hire them.\n\nThat said, uoft and at least some other Canadian schools are taking it too far in the other direction. I had my grades deflated at another business school because everyone did ""too well"". My A became a B because too many people got A+. SAT style. Leave it.

Ask the FAS Dean to interpret the [grading practices policy](https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/secretariat/policies/grading-practices-policy-university-assessment-and-january-1-2020) to her chairs. Focus on 3.1, in which it is the Dean's responsibility to make sure that grading practices are consistent. \n\nNote that some departments (without singling one out) have policies for pushing grades down in anomalous years, while others do not (an inconsistency). Further note that when these adjustments are made, it appears to be happening behind the scenes, without students being informed (a violation of section 3.5). \n\nPropose that, except in extreme cases, adjustments at the end of the term be replaced with better guidance to new instructors prior to the course (and reiterated at the midterm point). Ask that the practice of downward adjustments be discouraged consistently across the division and that the policy in section 3.5 be upheld.

1716485991.0,"As promised, I strolled through Kings College and this is what it looked like","Just want to start by saying that I don‚Äôt remotely belong to either cultural group. I was born in Toronto and have had the privilege of a life without civil war. My only stake in this situation is that I was a student during the fall/winter semester when the conflict started hitting headlines and I‚Äôll be graduating in June. I‚Äôll be observing the people who will be protesting on convocation day alongside my peers, who have all been pretty quiet about this topic. This post is for the people who are curious to know what their graduation ceremony is going to look like if its at the convocation hall next week.

The impression I got from this encampment was this: it was quiet, there wasnt anybody blocking doors to the adjacent buildings, and there wasnt really an air of chaos that has been exaggerated on insta. Its peaceful. It was just asian tourists visiting the campus for their kids and people going to and from class. There is an entrance to the encampment thats being guarded by a handful of people, but not much human activity. Of the 6 whole protestors I saw, it wasnt exactly a mixed group, but my sample size is too low to really confirm anything. No they were not wearing masks or trying to conceal their identity. Unfortunately it smells like weed and other things you could guess would come from an encampment, but thats to be expected. In contrast, there was a lot of construction going on and contractors working all around the encampment. I feel a little bad. That whole stretch of park has no shade so I wager its hot as hell in there.

So no, Kings College isnt a warzone, and you can go about convocation without feeling unsafe. There are a number of places where you can take decent pictures without getting tents in the background. Nobody is blocking doors and going after eachother.

‚Äî

One person on this reddit said that uoft put the fence up to deliberately stop the anticipation of a protest, but after visiting today I think that‚Äôs just bs. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I counted at least 3 other sites that were fenced off for construction and landscaping all around the circle. Plus, the work that is being prepared for the circle was no different from the construction on Robarts and Woodsworth. Its ironic that this same fence is now being used as a barrier preventing contractors, or really anybody, from entering the park. I did not try to enter this checkpoint thing, and I‚Äôm aware that other journalists have attempted to do this with varying results.

I finally formed an opinion on this. I think it‚Äôs great that people are practicing their freedom of expression. You should be allowed to advocate for vulnerable groups without getting shot by cops. While I think the war/crimes against humanity is awful, I actually don‚Äôt really support the encampment and their demands. Literally every facet of our country has had a direct and indirect involvement in supporting warfare beyond our borders. So even if they were to succeed in getting UofT to stop being involved with companies like Hebrew University of Jerusalem(??), or the Daughters for Life Foundation (?????) I honestly dont believe the unrelenting warfare in the middle east-east asia will ever really end. Children will still die at the same rate, relief workers will still die, genocides are still going to be funded by Canadian corpos, families will still face tragedy, and the isms will continue onward because nobody can agree on how the borders should be redrawn. 

A brief crash course on the history of Israel in my undergrad still feels true to me. I know that is my oblivious privilege talking, but this is all I see before me. There are so many problems in the world and I only have the energy for the ones happening here on this side of the globe. The fentanyl epidemic, the children who make up the majority of clients in Canadian foodbanks, the unaffordability of life as we know it, and the isolated elderly populace here in the GTA have my full attention. 

I‚Äôm at peace with the protest and I wish the protesters well. If they get UofT to yield to their demands, that is awesome and I‚Äôll applaud their efforts. I hope other people find their peace with this too.

People have started making money, taking big steps in relationships, etc while you're playing catchup. I think failing as a gifted kid (OP I think, myself, etc) in the one thing (school) you were labelled exceptional at can screw with your head big time, especially when everyone expects you to be so much more.\n\nThe bright side:\nAs everyone's mentioned here, don't compare yourself to others. Forget about the past, set your own current goals, put your head down and grind it out. That's what helped me. After doing bad and having a bad mindset, I made a 1 year plan. What did I want to have achieved 1 year from now? I made a routine that I could follow for school, gym, food, etc. I got into a groove. Every day following the routine was a win, because I knew it was leading towards my goals. It became a healthy addiction and it reflected in my life.

Now I'm a few years into my tech job and super happy!\n\nIMPORTANT: The most important thing was not that I graduated, it was that I achieved the planned goals I grinded 100% for.

You can see the original announcement by the Reddit admins here:¬†[https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/65xcya/omg\_its\_here\_new\_process\_for\_removing\_moderators/](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/65xcya/omg_its_here_new_process_for_removing_moderators/) 

It was soon after that¬†there was a new group of moderators who managed to take over the subreddit.¬†The original creator of the subreddit is now no¬†longer¬†the same top mod and the rest of the moderators were all added shortly afterwards.

Now all within this preceding time, it has also been widely exposed in mainstream media that there is¬†foreign influence from China at universities, typically through student groups and local¬†Chinese¬†state-backed organizations. This has been a big problem at¬†Australian universities with pro-Beijing protests breaking out. And recently in Canada as well, going as far as having some of the influence being direct connections to or support from China's Consulate¬†General.¬†

Now given all this, it would not be a stretch at all to suggest that it‚Äôs possible there are state-backed actors are behind the U of T subreddit.¬†We've seen it happen with the Russians on Twitter and Facebook, it's only a matter of time Reddit gets hit. I'm surprised the media isn't looking more into this yet. 

Just as a very simple example, if you do a subreddit search of anti-CCP phrases on this subreddit - such as in support of Hong Kong like 'free hong kong', you‚Äôll find almost no results whatsoever.

In contrast, other university subreddits like r/uwaterloo or r/berkeley have multiple occurrences of this phrase show up in their search, such as is common on university subreddits with socially and politically active university students.

You will notice the same trend for mentions of ""Xi Jinping"" and ‚ÄúCCP‚Äù.¬†

Also, a manual inspection of several controversial posts from this subreddit regarding China, you will also find many removed or deleted comments, presumably ones negative about the Chinese government, as only moderate sounding comments remain.","[""Why is Chinese added to the description and title of the subreddit? Not that it's problem, but if Chinese is being included, then shouldn't other languages as well?"", ""If mods delete this, it's confirmed"", 'just noticed we recently added mandarin to the desc and title of the subreddit.', 'Good for them wasting resources on a uni subreddit full of weeb fan art and the five same first year questions every year lmao.', 'Ah shitüëÄ.... happy accidental death buddy', '[removed]', 'It‚Äôs truly unfortunate that op killed himself next week', '""XI 2020""', 'It‚Äôs no secret at this point. The UofT Magazine did an interview with someone anti-CCP about the Hong Kong issue but they were pressured into not publishing it. When people posted about it in this subreddit, their posts were removed by the mods. Pathetic...\n\nEdit: It is the UofT magazine that was pressured into not publishing the interview, not The Varsity.', ""I never noticed the change before, but I feel like it would make more sense to have the Subreddit description in English and French before English and Chinese, given that French is an official language here. I don't necessarily have a problem with Chinese being there, but if we're going to have languages other than English on here, then French should be one of them\n\nHere is the description in French: Tout ce qui concerne les activit√©s acad√©miques, sociales et culturelles √† l'Universit√© de Toronto\n\nJust pop that in and we're all good"", 'Uoft loves that CCP money', 'This is a serious problem and one worth looking into.

This is not a new trend and it\'s not unique to this sub. We literally have a subreddit called /r/watchredditdie that notes this on a constant basis. So while I feel like your argument is pretty weak and your evidence circumstantial at best, I also would not be surprised nor angered if this was indeed the case.\n\nBut, another possibility is that this subject is HIGHLY controversial and is not something that the mods of this subreddit want to participate in nor do they feel it\'s critically important to UofT life. We have some pretty significant numbers of international Chinese students - with something like [65.1% of international undergrads and 14.6 of total undergrads being Chinese int students in 2017](https://thevarsity.ca/2018/11/27/data-at-u-of-t-gender-demographics-donations-wireless-connections/#:~:text=With%2065.1%20per%20cent%20of,total%20undergraduate%20population%20in%202017) (which perfectly explains the ""strange sudden addition of Chinese to the description""). It makes sense to me that mods either do not want to take a side in such a controversial subject to **(a)** not upset Chinese students who may feel strongly one way or another, **(b)** not take a direct side thereby potentially adversly affect the influx of Chinese students (whether it be by parents or a government who no longer want to send childen to a faculty that supports xyz).\n\nBut also, you can voice and hold a certain view without being controlled by someone else. We see this all the time in blogs, small news organizations, etc. So it\'s possible that **(c)** the mod(s) simply has a certain opinion and feels strongly about it - instead of being a covert Chinese communist subreddit agent. If I had the choice I might prefer against a bias, but Reddit doesn\'t owe me shit, and I continue to use Reddit, so I\'m fine with it.\n\nI just think you\'re reaching a little. Occam\'s razor or whatever, right?', 'While it is possible that we have a bunch of CCP hired actors, I think you‚Äôd be surprised by how many people willingly take on the role of ‚Äúdefending China‚Äôs honour‚Äù or censoring any ‚Äúhate speech against China‚Äù.

1614806817.0,100 Years Ago Today [3 March 1921] University of Toronto doctors Frederick Banting and Charles Best announce they‚Äôve isolated insulin.,,"['They sold the patent for $1.', 'i swear every pcl course i‚Äôve taken finds some way to talk about this', 'Wow the fact that I walk the same halls as these two men with my 2.7 cgpa is just... insultingü§£', 'The name ""insulin"" was coined by Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer in 1916 for a hypothetical molecule produced by pancreatic islets of Langerhans (Latin insula for islet or island) that controls glucose metabolism. Unbeknown to Sharpey-Schafer, Jean de Meyer had introduced very similar word ""insuline"" in 1909 for the same molecule.\n\nIn October 1920, Canadian Frederick Banting concluded that the digestive secretions that Minkowski had originally studied were breaking down the islet secretion, thereby making it impossible to extract successfully. A surgeon by training, Banting knew that blockages of the pancreatic duct would lead most of the pancreas to atrophy, while leaving the islets of Langerhans intact. He reasoned that a relatively pure extract could be made from the islets once most of the rest of the pancreas was gone. He jotted a note to himself: ""Ligate pancreatic ducts of the dog. Keep dogs alive till acini degenerate leaving islets. Try to isolate internal secretion of these and relieve glycosuria.""\n\nIn the spring of 1921, Banting and Best successfully isolated insulin, a discovery that would prove to be monumental for diabetes research and treatment.\n\n//////////////////////\n\nFor more information on little-known history and other 1920s events, consult the 100YearsAgoLive Project, a Twitter program that reports events from exactly 100 years ago as if they‚Äôre happening in real time.

Banting didn\'t ""discover insulin"", he discovered how to isolate and purify insulin from an animal pancreas. Pharm companies are not even using pancreas to get insulin. The way pharm companies are synthesizing insulin has nothing to do with Banting\'s method or discovery.\n\nBanting\'s discovery has been saving millions of lives, but modern insulin production doesn\'t rely on Banting\'s discovery.', 'By ""ofc it fucking does"" if you mean ""how Banting and UofT handled insulin discovery has to do with pharm companies now making millions off of insulin"" then that\'s not right. By saying it has nothing to do with how they handled it, it is meant that there is nothing wrong that Banting and UofT did regarding the aftermath of the discovery that made pharm companies or other parties easier to exploit his discovery. Banting and UofT handled it perfectly regarding patenting, legal and  administrative matters. And you can\'t even patent insulin because it\'s a natural peptide made in the body. you can only patent the formulation. Banting would not be able to patent insulin even if he wanted. \n\n> regardless of manufacturing methods \n\nThere is no such thing as regardless of manufacturing methods. Manufacturing methods do matter. You are not paying for the idea that someone had discovered that a pancreatic hormone treats diabetes. you\'re paying for the production and delivery of insulin. \n\n>  have driven up the prices sky high \n\nYou can still buy insulin extracted from pork and cow pancreas using Banting\'s method from Walmart like 5 bucks. But if you want high quality, safe, pure insulin with no risk of allergic reactions then you gotta pay the price. Your argument is like saying ""why does iPhone cost so much if the person who made the first cell phone had made it affordable"".\n\n> Pharmaceutical companies have taken advantage of a proven treatment \n\nIt was known, way before Banting\'s, that pancreas produces a hormone helping to regulate blood sugar levels. The only question was how to isolate and purify that hormone. Banting provided a solution to that problem. But pharm companies nowadays are not concerned with that question, because they\'re not even using pancreas as source of insulin. They\'re not using animal source. They are justified to patent their method, it\'s completely different technique with different source, different procedure. You can still use pork insulin if you want, it\'s still very affordable.', 'üò≠ ur so right', 'big pharma simp, a rare find', 'Ofc it fucking does as in its very relevant to point out the deep desire for Banting to have insulin be as widely accessible as possible and contrast it with a market system where insulin is artificially driven up. You seem to be labouring under the assumption insulin is being sold at some affordable price with slim margins of profit - this couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. The pharmaceutical industry is the furthest thing from a transparent free market. \n\nThe price of insulin in the UK, where the government negotiated directly with other companies, the price is ‚Äúmagically‚Äù lower than the US - with companies still enjoying profitable margins. Prices are increasing at higher rates than inflation, even for your human insulin at Walmart. The US supply chain for pharmaceuticals in general is murky.', 'I would prefer if the prices were lower but what I\'m saying is that Banting\'s discovery or what Banting desired or whether he patented it or not have nothing to do with the insulin market of nowadays. You can advocate for lower prices but your argument should not be ""Banting wanted it to be affordable for everyone"", or ""Banting didn\'t want people to make profit out of it"", ""UofT gave access to everyone to make insulin"". Those are not valid points in this discussion as I\'ve explained in my previous comments.', "">You seem to be labouring under the assumption insulin is being sold at some affordable price with slim margins of profit\n\nNot at all. I said pharma companies are justified in setting the prices that way. \n\nThe problem is that animal insulin (Banting's approach) are no longer used. What Banting desired doesn't matter anymore because it's not his approach that is being used. Rather than getting angry at pharma companies for charging high prices for developing purer, better, potent, more efficient product because of their completely novel technique you better push governments to build facilities to develop animal insulin. But I guess that's not efficient way of producing insulin considering the world population. It's not pharma companies fault that there are no animal insulin on the market."", '>What Banting desired doesn\'t matter anymore because it\'s not his approach that is being used.\n\nidk if you\'re missing the point intentionally. It\'s not about ""Banting\'s way is best"". The Banting comment is relevant bc he felt, like many people feel today, that essential medicine shouldn\'t be so hard for people to get - and that there\'s limits to how much profit you should be making. \n\n>Rather than getting angry at pharma companies for charging high prices  for developing purer, better, potent, more efficient product because of  their completely novel technique you better push governments to build  facilities to develop animal insulin\n\nchrist\'s sake dude, you sound like you do copy write for a pharm company. \n\n>I said pharma companies are justified in setting the prices that way\n\nAnd I disagree with this. They are not justified in setting the prices that way and in fact, they only do that in the US. Why should I push governments to build facilities to develop animal insulin when I can just push governments to act as single market buyers and drive down costs? (Something Medicare isn\'t allowed to do in the US bc they\'re fucking stupid) Or incentivize new players into the insulin market by offering subsidies or tax cuts? Or a dozen other things than sit there and go ""yeah this is the free market at its best"" when that\'s clearly not the case.']",832

Suppose that there exists a society wherein opportunity is not evenly distributed across group divisions at birth. In this society, groups that have less resources (food, shelter, safety, role models, literal money, legal rights, positive societal attitude, etc.) are less likely to do well, if we assume relatively equal distribution of genetic talent and hard work across groups. To illustrate this, imagine two individuals (I'm using they/their personal pronouns to keep their sex ambiguous) with exactly equivalent genetic potential at birth (IQ, conscientiousness, etc.):\n\nAlex was born into an upper socioeconomic class. Alex never had to spend energy worrying about their safety. Alex never had to worry about basic needs, and had many people around themselves that they admired and could model themselves after. Suppose Alex' parents are competent and didn't spoil them and they learned to value hard work and applies themselves to their goals, usually successfully.\n\nJamie was born into a lower socioeconomic class. Jamie lived in unfriendly neighborhoods and worried about their safety often. Their next meal was never guaranteed, and Jamie has never seen someone that looks like themself succeed in anything, and does not have confidence in their own prospects in life. Jamie's dad was never there at birth, and although their mom tries hard to provide what they need, they did not have the advantage of full parental guidance. However, through luck and hard work, Jamie learned to value hard work and applies themselves to their goals, with varying success.\n\nAlex and Jamie are both recent graduates from a respectable university, and their undergrad cGPA was exactly the same, an impressive 3.9. Looking back at their university application, however, we see that Alex was admitted with a high school average of 98%, while Jamie was admitted with a high school average of 94%. Knowing what we do about their group backgrounds, we can reasonably hypothesize that this disparity of high school grades could be attributed to their unequal opportunity at birth, but that the university made a good decision admitting them both, as they seem to have been of equal talent and merit.\n\nThe challenge for institutions that implement affirmative action is finding out how to score someone's 'privilege' or lack thereof, so that they can fairly admit people based off character and merit, rather than circumstances out of their control like socioeconomic class. As it stands, the most popular way to achieve this is to give more advantage to broad social groups such as African-ethnic groups, women, and transgenders. This reflects the existing sociological research that shows group disadvantages for those belonging in these groups.\n\nObviously, only providing letters of reference for people who are 'indigenous, black, or transgendered' is an imprecise way of achieving equality of opportunity, but it is in the spirit of the argument I laid above based off the values of merit. Unfortunately, sociological models of group differences tend to be overly generalized, and better data and models need to be made in order for precise implementation to occur.\n\nTL;DR existing implementation of affirmative action is not perfect, but we can reasonably argue in favor of it based off the values of character and merit. In a perfect world, we can assign 'privilege' scores and give opportunity accordingly, but whether such perfect models can ever be made is not certain."", 'You sound like a dumbass', '[deleted]', ""No, actually, you're saying that people would lose their minds if this Professor had said that he will write recommendations for Indian, Chinese or White students instead of Black and Indigenous ones, when that is an objectively terrible false equivalence and betrays a complete misinterpretation of this country's, and of the world at large, history with Black and Indigenous people. \n\nAnd you are in fact delusional if you think anyone is basing grad school admissions based on race, when this is a professor saying that he will write recommendations for students who either worked with him, OR have a 90+, OR come from marginalized and disadvantaged communities that have always been discriminated against by literally everyone for hundreds of years.

They're trying to help groups that may have had harsher lives because of past discrimination. As I said, it costs you nothing. You're not being obligated to play any game of debts. Just let the professor try to do a little extra to help people who society has historically left behind and pushed down."", ""That's fair, and I could see what you mean that affirmative action doesn't help to address the inequality that LGBTQ+ persons face as queer-ness is different from race and ethnicity. \n\nI'm not sure what a more appropriate solution would be."", '""There is no evidence for this""\n\n""Here is the evidence - In fact, there are entire fields of scholarship devoted to this"" \n\n""That is leftist propaganda. I do not accept that evidence."" \n\nWhew how did I not see it, you\'re right, you got me, I don\'t think - wish I could peek into that big brain of yours.\n\nedit: typo', '""If we can\'t help literally everyone, why help anyone?""', 'I mean this prof is clearly doing far more than you are, so who are you to talk about helping disadvantaged groups?', 'Again, doesn‚Äôt make sense to discredit a whole community bc u weren‚Äôt subjected to as bad discrimination. Have u had ur hijab ripped off? Maybe been attacked on the streets because of your looks? I can go on.\nBlack people still face discrimination in every way today and do go through a ton of challenges\n\nThis does not mean you have to ignore shit that happens to other minorities as well', '\\> This is an absolutely moronic take. No wonder this sub is full of incel CS majors who have been raised in such sheltered or insulated environments that they can\'t grasp basic sociology. You obviously have no understanding of how the world works or about how social progress is achieved. ""spread the word about education in those specific communities and call it a day""? Are you 4 years old? You know that groups that have been systematically entrenched in poverty and that have for hundreds of years faced a complete and utter obstruction of access to education and involvement in industry? \n\nO\' great one, what majors art thou enrolled in? Generalizing a whole major of people as incels (Im guessing you are judging u/MasterChief51 as I havent mentioned a thing about CS/States or whatever the hell you think Im majoring), yea you dont sound divisive, at all.  Apparently brown people havent systematically been entrenched in lower incomes, only black people have. You clearly have not been disadvantaged to look at how the average brown person is doing in this country, its not so well. You say its a problem with black people\'s culture, well thats racist to classify that as a cultural issue, wouldnt you say? But lets move on, why not help them fix their culture then, instead of propping a select few black people up?  WHAT IS THE OBSTRUCTION OF EDUCATION, when you are forced to go to school for 12 years and everyone knows/is informed by the highschool that you can apply through OUAC?\n\n\\>  that do not have a culture of encouraging education \n\nAgain, seems to make it an issue of culture. If that is the issue, then work with them to fix the culture, no? Moreover, if the problem is wealth, then education doesnt necessarily mean more money, there are a lot of highschool grads making good money. Doesnt make sense to put everyone else at a disadvantage, who are trying, by prioritizing one group only.\n\n\\>   How a kid from a single parent working household, or a kid with parents working double jobs,  \n\nI know many Asian/South Asians in similar roles with their parents, including me.\n\n\\>  kid in a community with no one around them to help them understand or achieve higher education doesn\'t see college applications like you do \n\nMany of my South Asian friends had no idea how university applications worked (especially if they were the older sibling), since their family has no clue how applying to university even works in Canada, since they arent from here. They had to figure all that shit out themselves, just like me.\n\n\\>   or a kid who has to work jobs during high school, \n\nMany of my Asian/South Asian friends had to work a job on the side to support family, still do that in university. \n\n\\>  or who doesn\'t have funds for college or even an understanding of financial aid or scholarships, \n\ndoesnt limit this issue to black people only. again, Ive had this issue to financial aid is always a issue.\n\n\\>   or who is unable to perform well at school because their family or community is fucked, because they\'re poor, because they have nobody to help them, because the schools in their neighbourhood suck and don\'t have funding, because they\'re bullied, because their families don\'t understand or don\'t help or don\'t support them, \n\nIm going to just address them all. Universities are no ""secret"" thing that we had to go hunting for in the forest, especially not in the 2010s. If the person is interested in it enough, most of this stuff can be researched by one\'s own means, all the tools are given. I think what we are leading towards is, maybe they are just NOT interested in university, and my friend, that is OK-thats alright. A friend was not interested in university, hes doing well in college now, and is on the hunt for jobs.\n\n\\>  But the fact of the matter is that they do not face the same problems with illiteracy, poverty, governance, and simply do not have thee experience that Black immigrants (let\'s not even speak about those Black Canadians who didn\'t immigrate) do, and are not in the same socio-economic circumstances. ""immigrants"" are not a monolith. Your life is shaped by a combination of your race, culture, family, and personal identity. \n\nThis is the part I deeply disagree with, and let me go into why. Asian/South Asians are facing similar issues everyday: poverty is a major issue, governance as well (South Asians governments are corrupt in every way, which is the reason why they came here). Illiteracy, this is interesting, now South Asians coming in arent illiterate, but most of their experience means jack shit in Canada, so from the Canadian way they are kind of illiterate. How are they NOT in the same socio-economic circumstances, Asian/South Asian arent coming here with stable jobs in their hands, infact many come here to work low-income jobs. Maybe immigration has changed in the last year or so, but my experience with the South Asians families I know are similar, many end up working low-end jobs. \n\n\\>  Yeah, you obviously don\'t know what the term ""model minority"" means. And I have never claimed that Black people are the ""2nd place on unemployment"", because like I said, the conversation is about education, not employment. What even is the logic behind ""brown and arab people have the highest unemployment rates so UofT should uplift brown and arab kids in admissions even though they are 25% of the student population despite being 5% of the over all population! clearly they are disadvantaged in the education department!"" \n\nSouth Asian/Arabs may make majority of it, but how is giving extra things to black people already there making things better for black people and society? Instead of the most qualified, we get people who are of a certain race, how does this improve society? The most qualified given the power, I believe can improve society, not someone who isnt. Im arguing that merit based things, should remain merit based for everyone and not freely given away to one type of people.', 'Dude dont waste your brain with these people. They lack empathy and understanding. Stressing about cs and stats has turned them into pessimists and toxic competitors who cry when anyone else is given the upper hand.

You could argue why that isn't included? There are many factors at play, and it's not going to be the case that everyone who falls into those minority groups will face hardship.

It is a fact that BIPOC people face more hardships on average than your typical white student for example. How is it racist to then offer them aid? Like if I went and gave money to a black lives matter charity am I racist because I didn\'t also go give money to a white pride charity? Don\'t be daft.\n\nAs to ""why not help the people who need help"", I think this is what everyone should strive to do. And what this professor is doing is a step in the right direction. The average is to do nothing, and just give references to those with the highest GPA, that is, the people who need help the least. If you look at your goal of giving help to those who need it, you should be criticising literally every professor except this one lol. Nobody has time to critically evaluate the class and welfare of every student in their class to make the perfect decision of who to give their limited reference letters to. So don\'t be hypocritical and act like this is against the welfare of the students.', 'Whats your point? How does that have anything to do with what we are talking about? I don‚Äôt remember us arguing about the effectiveness of grad studies', ""Yes, and in fact there is assistance given to people disadvantaged by socioeconomic class. Financial aid like scholarships or bursaries do weigh more towards those from lower income families. However the professor wouldn't have a way of having access to that information, so if they wanted to help (which I think they are) they'll go with what they can know. Which is that certain groups tend to have worse life situations. \n\nAnd yes, while the prof was trying to help, I do feel that they weren't being entirely inclusive of all disadvantaged groups by only specifying black, indigenous, and transgender. It definitely does exclude other people in the LGBTQ+ community as well as other racial groups. The professor's attempt here is definitely far from perfect."", 'Hey, thank you for engaging with me on this, this is a great question (although perhaps I disagree with part of your premise). \n\nHere is my take on this:\n\nSystemic disadvantages are not refutable in my opinion, based on my lived experience as a straight, cis, white man, and based on fields of scholarship that deal with topics such as this (sociology, philosophy, gender and racial studies) - There is a solid argument against affirmative action like this, based on the assumption that systemic inequality exists. That solid argument, in my opinion, is that affirmative action doesn\'t actually serve to redress the systemic things that give BIPOC and LGBTQ+ disadvantages in the first place, so much as it serves to tick a ""diversity box"". I think there is an argument still, however, the better equipping BIPOC and LGBTQ+ students for serious graduate work, would serve to address systemic inequalities in graduate admissions. \n\nHowever, as an educator the responsibility is more serious than just being able to shake those things off. Affirmative action might be the 2nd, or 3rd best thing compared to actual systemic changes - unfortunately those larger changes are hard fought and hard won, and can take decades. In other words, affirmative action is a band aid solution. \n\nWhile it\'s possible for a professor to chip away at those larger systemic inequalities over the coming decades, sometimes the best solution is a solution for today. This is where affirmative action has its place. \n\nThe argument that I *don\'t* think refutes affirmative action is your argument above. ""Great. Now what about all the other disadvantaged groups which this professors efforts aren\'t helping, or is fixing the problem for one group and one group only the desired outcome."" In other words, ""This isn\'t helping everyone, and if it can\'t help everyone, it\'s exclusionary."" I don\'t really agree with this viewpoint, sometimes it\'s just not possible to address every thing at once, and not being able to help 100% doesn\'t mean we should abandon helping the people we can help. I also don\'t believe that the success of one group, automatically means the failure of another group. In fact, I think that premise is what many of these systemic issues are based on, and those ideas should not take hold in my opinion. \n\nAlso, I\'m curious, just because I want to understand your viewpoint better - who are we putting at an ""even greater disadvantage"" through this action? And what are those newfound disadvantages for those people?']",834

1615570155.0,Does anyone else think LinkedIn is the most fucking pretentious social-media website on this planet,"I have been thinking about this a lot:

1. Everyone seems perfect with their perfect careers, yet when you actually dig in to see who the person actually is, you realize that they are actually a bunch of narcissists (I have first-hand experience with these people).
2. Everyone jerks each other off on that website about their accomplishments and gets a dopamine rush when they add something new to their profile.
3. Most of the things that people achieve are literally overinflated.
4. When you see everyone doing better than you, you obviously feel the effects of it.
5. Most of the site is just fucking boasting material to suck off their employer, and the funny thing is, everyone jerks off to how prestigious some companies are, yet they don't discern that they make you work literally 80 hours (40 of which unpaid) for many bigger companies (I have seen it myself). It is essentially a mating signal to your employer.
6. Everyone thinks success is only driven by the prestige of the job and the pay of the job, which is actually not true at all.
7. A lot of people in more ""prestigious"" fields have this superiority complex and arrogance that makes people doing ""less prestigious"" fields feel like shit. It's a poisonous way of thinking - It makes you feel empty and unfulfilled for both the exploiter and the exploited.

Otherwise any student who feels like they're going to fail anyway might as well cheat.

1588052437.0,A prof's perspective on integrity,"It seems that people in this sub think that every prof out there is a person who is obsessed with making students' lives miserable. It also seems as if people aren't even aware that profs are humans, too. Humans who are - for the vast majority - trying their very best in this situation. Humans who - just like students - can feel burdened, freaked out or stressed.

So, just for your entertainment, let me share some stories with you.

Background: I am a Prof in a Department in the Faculty of Arts and Science (I will not answer questions about which department or what general field).

* Imagine you mark the take home final exam and a student who scored 25% and 30% in term tests all of a sudden scores 95% in a final exam.
* Imagine you make your take home final open book and everything. You warn your students not to seek for solutions online. And still, within an hour, your exam is posted 40 times all over the internet on websites, asking for solutions.
* Imagine you have a case where a student's submission is a verbatim copy (to the very last punctuation mark) of a solution found on one of those websites and you invite that student to a meeting and they are telling you a story that is so bullshit you can't even.
* Imagine you have a student who submits a solution using vocabulary that you never ever remotely covered in this class and is only used in advanced courses of your field (suggesting that they had the solution written up by a for-hire grad student making some extra cash)
* Imagine you come to this sub before exam season and it is full of students asking for advice what Quercus tracks and what the prof can see, i.e. directly asking for advice on how to cheat.
* Imagine you also have to read in this sub endless posts saying that basically cheating is okay because it's easy and everyone is doing it anyways and profs are stupid to expect anyone not to cheat.
* Imagine you get messages from students who are anxious that they are the only honest one and that they are concerned that their peers will cheat but they don't want to cheat and it is freaking them out.

Now imagine seeing all this happen not just once but you have 60 cases of this, spread out over the online assignments in your course.

Oh and please don't tell me ""you are naive for expecting students not to cheat"". None of us wanted to go online. We had to. The faculty forced us to have online final exams. So we have to make it work somehow. Do you want us to say ""hey, cheating is okay, who cares, byeeeeee?"" Should we just give everyone an A++++?  How is that fair to the students who take the exact same course last year?

There are academic standards we have to uphold. There also is our own integrity as an academic that we have to uphold.

The admin load for profs has gone through the roof. Many of us have been working literally every waking hour since mid march. This is not an exaggeration. I have done nothing since mid march but sleep, eat, grocery shopping and work.

I have colleagues right now who can't sleep because they are just devastated by the rampant amount of cheating.  Profs are left entirely alone. They are not criminologists and yet they have to figure out cases, decide what evidence is ""solid"" or just ""circumstancial"" or what not. Why is everyone expecting us to be perfect investigators? I have a PhD in my field. I am a researcher and educator. I am not a trained criminal investigator.

Also if a Prof doesn't follow through with a case where they think an offence might have occured (even just ever so slightly suspecting it), they themselves commit an academic offence and can be sanctioned. Anything we suspect we must pursue or WE are the ones in trouble.

So if we look at your work and think ""looking at this, it's more likely they didn't cheat, but still it is suspicious enough to justify further investigation"", then you will be contacted.

So are some of you being contacted because of alleged cheating although you didn't do anything. Yes.Will you be penalized if you didn't cheat? No. Because all cases eventually go to the dean's office where they know very well how to handle evidence. But we aren't allowed to forward cases to the dean's office before jumping through the hoops of evidence collection and student meetings.

Academic offences are very different from criminal cases but let me entertain that failed analogy for a moment: The police has to go after anyone suspected of stealing. Then they collect evidence. Then a judge decides.

**You cannot expect to never be suspected of stealing just because you never stole something.**

It is a defining aspect of investigations that many innocent people will be suspected of an offence. Welcome to life.

EDIT: I want to clarify my last statement since people seem to like to misinterpret it. I am NOT saying that innocent people should be assumed to be guilty until proven innocent. I am only saying that innocent people will be investigated sometimes due to suspicions. That's something entirely different from ""guilty until proven innocent"".

EDIT 2: I want to also emphasize that I am not saying that the current process for integrity cases is good. Trust me, we don't like the 5,000 hoops we need to jump through either. The fact is that the process is so complicated and convoluted because students sued the university. These students didn't sue the university on grounds that they didn't cheat. Instead they sued the university that the process of how they were found guilty was not elaborate enough. That's the reason why it is this mammoth system now. We don't like it either.

EDIT 3: Thanks everyone for the conversation. This was really insightful. I also learned a lot more about the student perspective. I gotta run and will probably not monitor this post anymore.

In my personal experience as I am going through one right now I literally have no one to talk to besides anonymous people on reddit? You know why? Because everything else like downtown legal Services is shutdown because of the pandemic I can\'t even talk to my friends or family about this because it is embarrassing and that\'s make it even worse. I was lucky enough to finish all my exams before I got the email from my prof but if I hadn\'t I know for a fact I would have underperformed on my exams because of all the stress. How is that fair if you didn\'t even do anything in the first place? I do agree in some cases it is really obvious the student cheated but in some cases it\'s not but the mental toll it leaves is just not fair, for the prof it\'s just okay I\'ll forward all the evidence and I\'m done time for the department or dean to handle this (while a agree not all prof\'s are like this some definitely are) for the student it is world\'s apart. \n\nHere\'s what I feel: If I wasn\'t even able to convince the prof how will I convince the dean who at least to my knowledge doesn\'t have solid understanding of the coursework? Even though in my opinion I have really good evidence and notes backing up what I did, the dean literally can go your answer is similar to this student or similar to this website and boom things got worse.

I know people say if you did nothing wrong don\'t worry but it\'s really much more than that. Students are bound to cheat during these times and the innocent people who get caught up in this are left hanging. \n\nThe conclusion: I get how some profs might feel but I can guarantee the student ends up feeling way worse as after all its their future at stake here.

While I acknowledge that not much could have been done for courses that were stopped because of coronavirus, perhaps this situation requires UofT to really think about how students could meet the learning outcomes for a course. Is cheating OK? of course not, however in some cases it is the profs who are designing poor assessments that leads to problems in the course.   furthermore, one of the challenges when designing assessments is the number of students in the course. Number of students is an unacceptable metric for designing a test. If you are designing a test in a certain way because there are 1000 students in the course, and not because this is material that best allows students to demonstrate the learning outcomes, this is a problem. There are wider issues than academic integrity in the current situation. The larger context of testing is flawed, which perpetuates other issues, like academic integrity violations.', ""Thank you for your hard work! I get sick and tired of seeing students on here who feel entitled to cheat, and I think it's highly beneficial to hear an instructor's perspective."", 'F', ""Although I understand and agree on your perspective for this, the fact that many profs were not cooperative during this crisis just added a lot more unnecessary stress to so many students.\n\nI firmly believe that if the profs had an option to cancel the final exam and opt into a take home assignment that takes many more hours to do would have been much more beneficial.\n\nIf your goals as educators is for us to learn and have taken something from the courses we are taking, forcing us to take an online final is very counterproductive. There is the issue of cheating, but let's put that aside for now. Exams are designed to test us on our knowledge of the course material, and for many courses, there were 1-2 month period gaps between the midterm and the final, and since everything moved online, the way to learn the material drastically changed. This means that not everyone could learn the material properly, and thus basically forced many students to collaborate so that they could at least pass the course as a last ditch effort. \n\nHowever, if a take home assignment was issued instead that would challenge us to use the material from the course in new ways that would allow us to actually get us to think about the material, this would have actually been much more ideal as compared to an uncertain online exam. Yes, students could still cheat but I honestly think that if there was a lose lose situation, that this would have been much better. One of my courses did this, and I actually learned so much more about the course's material than I would have if I just attended class normally. It was just some elective that I took to satisfy my 40 credits, but I was genuinely surprised and enjoyed what this course had to offer. This is because I had to go through everything that was in the lectures myself many many times, and actually try to extract and infer on the information in there that would allow me to answer these questions. For this particular assignment, it took me a span of 3 days to complete, and it was done in a non stress environment as we had 3 whole days to complete this assignment. \n\nThere is also the issue with first/second year courses that are required for POSt admission. For these courses, I understand profs being rigorous as these are very competitive situations for spots in their respective specialization in their field. For profs to be more strict about admitting students to this is very reasonable. However for upper year courses, for students that were already in the program for a while, profs not being cooperative and making things much more stressful than they needed to be, when we are relying on getting these required credits to be able to complete our program, I just think is really uncalled for. For example, I am in CS, and there are quite a few theoretical heavy courses that are very challenging. My prof opted to keep the course as intense as it has always been  and to uphold the difficulty of the material, was just very demoralizing for me while preparing for the final. The content is not something that would concern many of the students unless they were considering grad school, and is essentially one of those courses that we just need to get over with. The pride in the course's reputation just really disappointed me. Even if he decided that an online exam was the best option, there were other changes that could have been made to the course such as re-weighting of the course's syllabus, or at least REMOVING THE AUTOFAIL GRADE ON THE FINAL. I really did not see a point to keep the autofail on the final for any reason whatsoever. Because in the grand scheme of things, 2.5 credits out of our 40.0 credits (may also be much less than 2.5 for part time students and/or the 2.5 credits being spread throughout several departments of courses) is very insignificant and should not cost the upper year students thousands of dollars more in tuition, and certainly should not cause us to delay our graduation.\n\nMost of this seems like a rant, and mostly it is, but I just wish that profs would be more flexible when especially their peers in the same departments are opting into changes that make it less stressful for the students, while being able to deliver on their objectives in the course they taught. I guess the takeaway that during this situation, there are no winners, and that should have been the mentality for everyone going in. Choices made should not have been to do best as possible, but instead should have had the objective of avoiding the most mistakes as possible."", ""As an alumni, I see the main issue is that the knowledge imbalance is simply too great. Most student do not have a background in law, yet this whole proceeding, as you have described, resembles a criminal trial.\n\nIt is very tough for students to have access to good legal council that can advise them on what they should say, what they need to be careful of talking about, and what is the best way to defend themselves.

Last year, well before all of this happened, I took a class had bi-weekly quizzes in tutorials. These quizzes were tainted every week by some of the most blatant cheating I have ever seen. The story that sticks most clearly in my mind is when the two students sitting directly in front of me were handing each other their actual quiz papers during the quiz. (It doesn\'t get much more blatant than that...) The TA noticed this, and simply walked over and said ""stop doing that"" once, and then walked back to his chair like nothing happened. That was the extent of his persecution, and the students immediately resumed their cheating as he was walking away. (because of course they did...) I have never cheated on anything in the past, nor do I intend to cheat on anything in the future, so, as I\'m sure you can imagine, this was incredibly discouraging to witness. \n\nI bring up this story for two reasons:\n\n1. To showcase that, unfortunately, when presented with the opportunity, certain people will always cheat, which sucks. I understand you are frustrated to see students posting exam questions online, and that is totally reasonable. Also, I want you to know that in addition to your frustration, there are tons of honest students in your classes that are just as frustrated as you are. Unfortunately, I think this scenario is somewhat inevitable, and there is not much any of us can do about it.\n\n2. While I have been fortunate enough to not have been wrongfully accused of an academic offense, I can only imagine how devastating it would be for one to be wrongfully accused (not to mention the stress it would cause), especially if they had witnessed blatant cheating as I have. I hope you can empathize with the pain/injustice that one would feel if they were wrongfully accused knowing that actual observed cheating has gone unpunished in the past.\n\nI don\'t bring these points up to defend the extreme actions of some students, nor to suggest that you or any other professors are doing anything wrong, or even to suggest that the system has to be improved. (because honestly, I am not even sure how one could improve this system, despite all of its flaws) I only want to provide some context that will hopefully allow everyone to empathize with one another. \n\nIn conclusion, I wish you the best of luck with your remaining tasks, and thanks again!', '‚ÄúYou cannot expect to never be suspected of stealing just because you never stole something‚Äù\n\nI was okay with the statements you made until this I‚Äôm tired of this whole guilty until proven innocent that professors have been preaching.

There are two explanations why this didn\'t happen: Possibly the prof forgot but but quite likely they are just swamped with work. I know of colleagues in other departments who get more than 100 emails a day from students. Imagine handling that. At that point you have to triage and ""telling a student their case was forwarded"" has a lower priority than ""helping a student who is currently stuck in a quarantine hotel in Shanghai and can\'t submit their coursework"" (emails like this come all the time these days, I\'m not making this up)\n* ""Still, the department has full control over the situation; I have none.  This is never a fair game. What if nobody believes me? How exactly am I  supposed to provide rock-solid evidence to prove I did not cheat?""I think you are making a very common misconception here, so I want to say again what I wrote to others: Unless you admit that you are guilty, the department can do nothing. NOT EVEN THE DEAN HERSELF can penalize you without you admitting it. The only body that can penalize you without admission is the Tribunal. They are a neutral entity where both you and the department submit their case. The department is not in charge of this.\n* ""I think there should be more ""guidelines"" as to what exactly should be considered evidence of academic offence.""Sorry for being a bit harsh here, but that is wishful thinking. There is an infinite number of ways to cheat and it\'s hard to make guidelines. Also every discipline is different. Think about how cheating is in a language versus a stem field. Admin staff is already overworked. Who would write those guidelines.\n* ""Since when did having similar solutions to other students  become evidence  for academic offence?""Let me ask you back: What kind of evidence should I as a prof produce when I think you copied from an online source? Obviously the only thing I can do is claim similarity of the solution. Do you want to to have camera footage of the student that they browsed online? Copying from an online source is one of the most common cases of cheating, not just in covid-times.

I am saying that for a prof, your behaviour doesn\'t look different from a student who is just good at telling stories.\n\nNote that no one but the university tribunal can penalize you without you admitting guilt.

There is the issue of cheating, but let\'s put that aside for now. Exams are designed to test us on our knowledge of the course material, and for many courses, there were 1-2 month period gaps between the midterm and the final, and since everything moved online, the way to learn the material drastically changed. This means that not everyone could learn the material properly, and thus basically forced many students to collaborate so that they could at least pass the course as a last ditch effort.\n\nOkay: Let me be clear one one opinion of mine: Cheating is never justified. Never ever. Frankly, I don\'t care about any excuse. If you need to ""pass the course as a last ditch effort"" that probably means that you performed poorly on earlier term work. Not everyone deserves to pass the courses they want to pass. That\'s why there are exams in the first place.\n\n>However, if a take home assignment was issued instead that would challenge us to use the material from the course in new ways that would allow us to actually get us to think about the material, this would have actually been much more ideal as compared to an uncertain online exam. Yes, students could still cheat but I honestly think that if there was a lose lose situation, that this would have been much better. One of my courses did this, and I actually learned so much more about the course\'s material than I would have if I just attended class normally. It was just some elective that I took to satisfy my 40 credits, but I was genuinely surprised and enjoyed what this course had to offer. This is because I had to go through everything that was in the lectures myself many many times, and actually try to extract and infer on the information in there that would allow me to answer these questions. For this particular assignment, it took me a span of 3 days to complete, and it was done in a non stress environment as we had 3 whole days to complete this assignment.\n\nLet me guess: your elective was a tiny class (Tiny for U of T means less than 60 students).

Since there are courses with an autofail condition on the final exam, there could have been accommodations, such as having a take home assignment as mentioned earlier. If that option was chosen as well, they could keep the autofail still, or at least have some sort of change. The difficulty of the material that needs to be evaluated can stay the same, but having a time-restricted environment certainly does not help the situation. Hearing one of my other profs describing Quercus being a nightmare to host an exam on, why would they choose to have a final in the first place?\n\nMy point of a last ditch effort is purely on fear of the autofail.

Unless you\'re an adjunct professor, then lecturing is usually a fairly small part of your workload. It\'s somewhere between 5 and 15 hours a week that you can go in front of bright eyed students, and talk about your specialty. Granted, that might also include time to do your lecture planning, office hours, labs, and time spent grading (though fortunately a lot of that can be offloaded to TAs), but it\'s still likely to be less than a third of a work week.\n\nIf you compare that to a K-12 teacher, who will spend much of their waking hours dealing with students, or student work, it certainly seems like school teachers have it much worse.\n\nHowever, when your time in class is done you have to go back to keeping up with news in your field, writing grant proposals, writing papers for journals, doing research, dealing with departmental politics, managing your grad students and staff, calls with equipment/consumable vendors, and budgeting fairly limited resources. That\'s where most of the challenge comes in. If a prof could just spend all of their time teaching... Well, they\'d be an adjunct for one, but at least the activity might be enjoyable for some. However, that teaching time is usually extra work, mandated by the school, on top of what you need to do anyway in order to keep your lab funded and functional, which is usually a more than full time job by itself. That job tend to involve a wide range of skills, from management, to politics, to conflict resolution, to writing, maintenance, negotiations, and a slew of other skills that you\'re more likely to associate with a business owner more than faculty at an institution of higher learning.\n\nThat said, I don\'t want to suggest the job is horrible by any means.

Two days ago, the World Health Organization determined that COVID-19 has reached the level of a global pandemic. Yesterday, among many other developments in Canada, the governments of Quebec and Alberta advised that indoor gatherings of more than 250 people should be cancelled, and the Ontario government announced that all public schools will remain closed for two weeks following the March break.\xa0\n\n\nContinually since early January, the University of Toronto has been monitoring the situation very closely and taking action as necessary in light of the global situation, the advice of public health authorities and the concerns of our community. We have also been liaising regularly with other post-secondary institutions and sector organizations, as well as Toronto Public Health, while consulting with our own U of T experts in public health. We have been informing members of our community accordingly, through a\xa0[website](https://www.utoronto.ca/message-from-the-university-regarding-the-coronavirus#faq)\xa0we created as a clearinghouse of authoritative information.\xa0\n\n\nYesterday we sent a memo directly to all students, faculty, librarians and staff on our three campuses, to update everyone on our planning for future contingencies. We announced the cancellation of all\xa0University-sponsored learning programs abroad. We advised that non-essential travel should be reconsidered and we recommended the cancellation or postponement of all discretionary events. We indicated the steps we have taken to\xa0[support instructors](https://memos.provost.utoronto.ca/covid-19-planning-for-completing-courses-this-term-pdadc-50/)\xa0in planning for the possible cancellation of in-person classes and examinations. We reiterated our advice that those who are sick should stay home, and we reminded community members of where they can find\xa0[more information](https://www.utoronto.ca/message-from-the-university-regarding-the-coronavirus#faq)\xa0online.\n\n\nAfter careful consideration of developments over the past 24 hours, we have made the following additional decisions.\n\n\nWe have decided to cancel all in-person undergraduate and research-stream Masters and Doctoral courses across U of T‚Äôs three campuses, and we will provide that teaching by other means\xa0(which may include existing online platforms).\n\n\nThis decision is effective this coming Monday, March 16 and continuing until the end of classes on Friday, April 3. (Please note that all in-person teaching scheduled for today, Friday, March 13, will continue as planned.)\n\n\nWith respect to professional programs, each of which has particular circumstances and accreditation requirements, consultation is ongoing today to determine the appropriate course of action.\xa0\n\n\nProfessional students as well as faculty members, other instructors and staff in these programs will be advised by this coming Monday morning, as soon as decisions have been made.\n\n\nUniversity operations continue, and all three campuses will remain open.\n\n\nLibraries, residences, food services, health & wellness centres, athletics and recreation facilities and other public spaces on all three campuses will remain open.\n\n\nOne of the key factors in these decisions is the need to foster a degree of ‚Äúsocial distancing‚Äù, as recommended by public health authorities. On that front, our goal is to help interrupt the chain of transmission in the wider community, thereby protecting vulnerable individuals and ensuring that our health care system will not become overburdened.\xa0\n\n\nI would like to extend special thanks to those faculty and staff members who have been involved in monitoring and analyzing this evolving situation and in charting the way forward for the University at this difficult time. Your dedication is remarkable and deeply appreciated.\n\n\nI salute our U of T clinicians and researchers who are making crucial contributions to the collective efforts to find solutions on the local, provincial, national and international levels. You make us proud.\n\n\nI would also like to thank all members of the University of Toronto community ‚Äì our students, faculty and staff members alike. We appreciate that the global COVID-19 pandemic is increasingly worrisome, and that the changes I have just announced will require very significant adjustments on everyone‚Äôs part. But, based on the strength of our bonds as a community and the good will that characterizes its members, we are confident that we will meet this challenge successfully.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nMeric S.

1637710786.0,I'm tired of the fetishization of CS majors,"The females on this campus are out of control. The first time I went to this tech talk wearing my UofT CS hoodie, I had literally 3 different women try to sit down and court me, like I would know how to talk to a girl. Oh, how I pity their male companions, who were still staying faithfully by their sides, but being completely abandoned all the while their women talk to me in the most seductive voice they could muster. Look, I know it's easy to get aroused by the mere presence of genius like me, but at least take a hint of my disinterest (I was there only for the free swag, mind you). I quickly demonstrated superior knowledge of each of their niche interests, which apparently eliminates me from the dating pool (why shame me for being smart?).

Anyway, that got them to leave, and since that episode, I've known enough to avoid Bahen Centre (A female hotspot apparently). However, the problem has persisted in the past 3 months -- a few determined souls still follow me to lunch spots and CS tutorials (the mere thought of a non-CS major trying to blend in among my kind makes me cringe), and I am so fed up with everybody wanting to get with me. I've taken to moving all the other chairs at tables I sit at to other tables, but yesterday a small Asian girl literally pulled up a chair and began ranting about Praxis. Girl, I don't struggle with Praxis. I'm a CS major, not an Engineer. After making it markedly clear that I did NOT in fact want to copulate in the SF pit, she finally left me alone, but I wish these girls would stop worshipping me just because I am enrolled in the hardest POSt at UofT (which was not difficult for me to get into, by the way).

The worst are when students from non-technical majors talk to me. We'll be having a nice, platonic conversation, when they inevitably ask the fateful question: ""What's your major?"" As soon as I say those two magnificent letters, I see their whole demeanor change. The doe eyes, the flushed cheeks, the jiggling cleavage. What makes an art major think they have a chance with me. Data Science and CS are on whole different planes of existence. I'm not about to impregnate somebody that puts ""Excel"" on the first line of their resume.

You may think I'm just remarkably handsome, which I am, but my attractive acquaintances in ECE (they're not smart enough to be friends, but their childlike innocence is sometimes enviable), have literally no problems with this incessant harassment and courting from female creatures. Females see me as an object and a genius, when really I'm so much more: I'm top 100 in the world in Destiny 2. My Meta shirt shouldn't reduce me to a bag of meat; if you want my heart, you have to grind with me, raid with me, join my clan, and most of all, eat brown food truck with me, and appreciate it -- no fake fans that use ""going to the washroom"" as an excuse to void the culinary experience of letting that poutine and hotdog macerate and emulsify satisfyingly inside you.

If you want somebody for cheap sex, the ECE majors are right there (I don't blame you for avoiding the Ryerson DDs though). Stop fetishizing my kind for something out of our control. I didn't want to be born a super genius. Hell, sometimes I wish I was an ECE major, moving through the world in ignorant bliss. But I have a responsibility now to save the world and create the next Facebook. Seductively whispering ""boundless"" isn't going to make me want to get with you. Come back with a Meric Gertler tattoo on your ass, code a Y combinator, or implement Djikstra's recursively, and then we'll talk.","['Wow, finally a troll post. Rarely do I see this on U of T reddit.

1600518889.0,Assault and attempted robbery at St. Michaels college last night,"Just a heads up to the uoft community.


I was walking my dog down st joseph last night at midnight and saw a sketchy looking man loitering between the two buildings by carr hall. As soon as he saw me he walked up to me and started asking about my dog. I was freaked out and it think my dog knew because she started growling, so he said ""woah chill"" and I quickly walked across the street and started walking towards bay st. 


Not more than a minute later I hear yelling. When I looked back the man was on top of some other guy with a backpack. There was a scuffle and eventually he saw me and another dog owner watching and ran to queens park yelling ""I just wanted you cell phone!"". When I approached the victim he was bleeding from his face and shaken, he said he didn't want to let go of his phone. I asked him if he was going to call the police but he said he just wanted to go home and left. The guy was shaking bad, clearly in shock. I think he was a student.


When I got home I called the police and filed a report. I remember exactly what the suspect looked like so I gave a description. Hopefully the student is feeling better and calls in to report as well.


Anyways just a heads up, please be careful and watch out for each other!","['Yikes, scary stuff! \n\nThank you for checking on the scuffle, calling the police, and filing the report. \n\nPlease accept this honorary medal of honor for your valiant actions ü•á', 'You are a good human.

He barley had any teeth I couldnt understand a word. The words I did understand were, go back to where you came from. Later on I found out she was a Sudanese person and she moved to canada less than a month ago\n\nShe was just clutching here baby and crying really hard, the dude was just yelling and yelling. the Kid in the stroller was unfazed playing with his truck.

Maybe it‚Äôs just because l‚Äôm Canadian, but it just blows my mind that guns are so easily accessible in America, our neighbours. I‚Äôve grown to have this irrational fear that when I cross the border, I‚Äôll immediately be at a risk of being shot. America is great but...guns just ain‚Äôt it  :‚Äô)', '[deleted]', ""I'm not necessarily disagreeing with you...   \n\n\nBut just saying. Guns are wayyyy more accessible in Canada than you might think (as well as way more common). Did my PAL (personal arms license) class when I came up here, and you'd be pretty surprised as to how lax the firearm laws are up here. Hell, outside of the concealed carry laws, I'd even argue that that - for a big city - Toronto actually has laxer gun laws than a good chunk of major cities in the states. (Being allowed to carry centerfire semi-auto rifles and shotguns in your car unlocked for example. Can't be loaded, but you could have a loaded magazine or clip right next to it if you want.)   \n\n\nNot to mention the gun community is wayyyyyy bigger than most people think. It's just not as out in the open as much in the states due to its taboo nature. Once again not disagreeing with you, just saying that it is honestly really really easy to get your PAL and an unrestricted firearm in Canada and that - in some regards - the laws regarding those unrestricted firearms are honestly even laxer than a good chunk of large cities in the states.   \n\n\n(Oh, and the hilarious part is that ar15's are considered restricted, but an SKS with a tapco stock/removable magazine is considered unrestricted)"", '[deleted]', ""I'd rather take a beating than get shot. Having guns available means guns are available."", 'I actually didn‚Äôt know guns were pretty common here! Thanks for bringing that to my attention. I think I just have the mindset cause of all the news coverage about shootings in America. Maybe the same things happen in Canada more commonly than I though but I just haven‚Äôt heard it from mediaü§∑üèª\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏èI‚Äôm not one to judge people‚Äôs political views, but having Trump as a president gives American people who are already racist/xenophobic/sexist feel justified in their beliefs and that can just lead to an endless cycle of violence. Guns before Trump were less concerning for me.', 'I‚Äôm not sure if this changes anything but you assumed wrong. I am actually a woman. I think I should have made things more clear. I am not completely against the carrying of guns. I think America just needs to work on gun control so they don‚Äôt get in the hands of the wrong people. Guns are necessary for the military, the police force etc. But how are morally corrupt mass killers getting their hands on them? I‚Äôm not trying to argue with you or tell you Canada is a better country but it‚Äôs not a coincidence that Canada recorded only 3 mass shootings between 2000 and 2014. Man, I feel like I‚Äôm coming off as patriotic but I actually feel like gun control in America could be taken a little more seriously.', '[deleted]', 'No problem!   \n\n\nI can absolutely understand those concerns regarding political culture. Personally, I do think that they are more an extension of media coverages. But then again, I\'m a vet from Texas so I absolutely have biases on my own that would discredit my own stance hahaha.   \n\n\nI think it\'s more of a factor of population. The USA is in a weird position where it has a huge population (being the third highest in the world) with a very individualistic stance on firearm ownership. With the legislative freedom we have to own firearms in combination with that large population (as well as the astronomically larger number of large cities in comparison with Canada), a higher rate of gun violence is to be expected since population size is directly correlated with violent crime in general. But it\'s also important to consider the conundrum of the number of un-reported crimes that are prevented by the simple action of an individual presenting a firearm (which number in the hundreds of thousands per year, but are much harder to quantify and report in the media since no ""action"" has taken place).  \n\n\nPersonally, I think - for the USA - the freedom to choose whether or not someone would like to own a firearm for personal defense is far more beneficial than the contrary. **But I absolutely do not think that this is a viewpoint that should be forced upon any other countries!** Having worked overseas for over 6 years before coming to U of T, I\'ve been lectured to about my home politics waayyyyyyy too many times lol and I refuse to be a hypocrite and say my way is better for another country. Hell, honestly I\'d say one thing I\'d love to see copied in the USA from Canada is ya\'lls mandatory gun safety class. Just because someone isn\'t a criminal doesn\'t mean they aren\'t a dumbass after all.   \n\n\nSorry, went off on a bit of a tangent lol. I guess my TL;DR point is that guns are actually far more common and pretty accessible in Canada as well, I just personally think that the much larger population in the USA (as well as the larger number of big cities) has more to do with the larger levels of gun violence than anything.', '[deleted]', '[deleted]', 'I totally understand, you‚Äôre entitled to your beliefs and I‚Äôm glad we can have this healthy discussion. Some people on the internet forget that everyone has different opinions lol.\n\nBut yeah I haven‚Äôt looked into gun laws in Canada because I haven‚Äôt seen it as a threat here. I‚Äôve never felt the need to have a gun. Maybe when I go downtown, I have this slight fear I‚Äôll get jumped or kidnapped. But Ive never gone to school afraid that it might be my last day to live. As a visible minority, I‚Äôve had bad experiences with racism in the states. I‚Äôm not saying all Americans are racist or violent, but the atmosphere just didn‚Äôt feel right. Or how it used to be when I visited family in the past. \n\nI also remember watching a documentary in English class ‚ÄúBowling in Columbine‚Äù outlining the Columbine shooting in America. I think it just surprised me that 2 teenage boys could get their hands on guns so easily and just casually purchase ammunition from a Kmart without raising suspicion. The fact that to this day, the number of mass shootings are increasing is crazy. Maybe living a pretty sheltered life, living in a small neighbourhood with little to no exposure to danger played apart in my stance. Btw I‚Äôm not trying to ‚Äúprove‚Äù to anyone that Canada is a better country out of patriotism. I‚Äôm just genuinely concerned for the future of America, as a neighbour.', 'I read those stats from an article but maybe I should have checked my sources since the number seems abnormally low. I actually referred to shootings as in school shootings. School shootings are very rare in Canada but have become common sadly in the US. This is a fact. Not something I believe in because I‚Äôm ‚Äúdelusional‚Äù. I‚Äôm not saying America is more violent, not at all. It would be stupid of me to think ‚ÄúMore people die in America because of guns‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm safe because I‚Äôm Canadian‚Äù. In fact, I feel like the violence that takes place in Canada is often overlooked in media worldwide because of our reputation as being so‚Äúpolite‚Äù. Of course, despite the gun control in Canada people find loopholes and that‚Äôs just inevitable. Anyways, I‚Äôm not forcing my opinions on you. I just expressed my concerns based on my own. Have a good one.', '[deleted]', ""That's totally understandable! Personal experience definitely does come into account I think as well.  Growing up in the south where all the high school seniors would literally bring a rifle/shotgun (locked in the back of a truck) to school and then go hunting after class with zero school shootings or threats, I was never afraid either and have the personal experience that would suggest that the danger of firearms in the US is more a problem of media promotion than anything.   \n\n\nBut like you said, personal experience really does influence everything! I'm sure someone who grew up in a big city in the US would definitely have a different experience in that regard lol."", '[deleted]', 'Totally agree. My experiences really influenced my opinions. I think being near someone who has possession of a gun is frightening. However, to a lot of Americans it‚Äôs probably normal to carry guns so there isn‚Äôt as much fear as it would be for me.

1662694297.0,Welcome Back! And some advice from a U of T prof,"I am a professor here at U of T - here for almost a decade now - and wanted to welcome our new students and give a bit of advice.

1) Man, are we happy to see students back in person.  The campus has not felt right since March 2020, and it is such a joy to see everyone's faces again, the soccer fields full, the library buzzing.

2) Talk to your professors!  If 10% of my students in any given class come to office hours, I would be amazed.  Even years later, I remember many of these students and are still in touch with them about their jobs, grad school apps, and so on.  What should you go to office hours for?  Discussions or extensions of what you learned in class, book and article recommendations, help with things you are struggling with, or even just to say hi.  Of course, ""complain about a fairly graded exam"" is not a great reason!  I suspect the vast majority of professors like to see their students showing interest - the only exception are the very large intro courses where it just isn't possible to give one-on-one attention.

3) We are a 94,000-student research university, including UTM and UTSC.  This has costs and benefits.  The benefit is that, in many departments, you really do have world leaders teaching your courses.  Many of my colleagues previously taught at Harvard, Oxford, Yale, etc.  In my classes, you'll never see a textbook - I try to teach at the research frontier in a way that, to be completely frank, you can only consistently get at a couple other universities in Canada.  We have undergrads like Aidan Gomez, who was a coauthor on the most important machine learning paper of the past decade when he was here and cofounded a company worth hundreds of millions of dollars.  The cost, of course, is that it can be anonymous.  This isn't high school. No one is watching to make sure you don't fall through the cracks.  If you have trouble in class, or don't show up, no one is going to call your parents.  Heck, I'm tenured here, and I literally have no idea where the President's office is, nor have I even set foot in most of the buildings on campus.  You need to make your own opportunities, but they are absolutely there.

4) What should you study?  A lot of first year students don't realize that there is a massive, causal gap in lifetime income across majors.  Basically, the more technical the major, the higher you'll get paid on average.  Engineering, CS, math, economics, philosophy, any of the pure sciences, some types of commerce.  If you go that route, though, make sure to take courses outside your major that you are interested in!  Study the French revolution, or the violin, or modernist literature.  Nobody regrets taking these classes ex post.

5) For all the talk I have seen here about the difficulty of U of T, it's important to note that we spend \*way\* less time in the class than peer institutions.  We do 10 classes, 2 semesters, 4 years.  A ""normal"" class is 24 hours in the classroom plus a final, or 260 hours a year (of course some classes are longer, have labs, etc.).  A normal US university schedule is 45 hours per class times 8 classes, or 360 hours a year.  This means that you should have a ton of time for extracurricular work after your courses.  Join clubs!  This is where you'll make friends that will be in your wedding party.  Go to talks!  There are dozens of awesome public talks each week.  When I was in university, I saw tons of world leaders, top scientists, great writers - and all for free.  

6) Half of university is courses.  The other half is peers.  If you come here by transit, go to class, then go back home, you are missing the whole point.  Talk about philosophy over cheap beer with your friends!  Be friends with people with wildly different backgrounds and political views!  The most noticeable thing for me about U of T is the number of students who are both isolated from the ""college experience"" but who also isolate themselves.  You need to put yourself out there - and I don't just mean class and the library.

7) For international students, the biggest gap that I notice in fourth years is between international students who spend a lot of time talking to native speakers and those who don't.  The former are among my best students.  The latter find it impossible to get a job when they graduate.  Getting out of your bubble is important for everyone, but especially second-language speakers.

8) If you feel like you are out of place, that everyone knows more than you do, that your peers seem more sophisticated, or more cool, that you really have to work to get through these tough classes - don't worry, so does everyone their first year.   You are not alone.

9) Don't cheat.  I assure you, all of your professors would prefer to not even give grades.  You are the one paying, and it's your own learning at stake.  It sounds trite, but you are really just cheating your future self.  

10) A big difference from when I was in school a couple decades ago, that has been quite negative in my view, is how often students want the university to solve their problems.  Roommate bothering you? You're an adult.  Figure it out yourself. Feeling depressed?  Talk to a friend, or a family member, or a counselor.   Upset about something political?  Organize a group, write a letter to the paper, do some research.  The university is not your friend, or your therapist, or your partner in activism - it is here to teach you things, period. If you think the university does a shitty job at something other than teaching or research, it is because the university is literally not set up to do those other things, and only is involved in a half-hearted way because of pressure from students in the past.  Your expectations should be very low.

11) All else equal, I would take courses from research-track professors rather than lecturers or sessionals/grad students.  Some of the latter are very good, no doubt.  And many will be better as \*teachers\*.  But the content is generally not going to be at the same level as the research-active folks can give, and the whole point of going to a top research university is to be exposed to those ideas.

12) Most importantly, your time in university should be fun!  You want to look back fondly on that wild night at El Mo, the crazy prank you pulled, the intramural basketball championship you won, the 20th century physics class that got you to change majors, your classmate who you're sure is a future Prime Minister.  This is the first time most of you are truly independent, and the last time most of you have no constraints on your future.  It's honestly an incredible period of your lives that I feel really grateful to share with you.  

I'll pop back in this thread to answer any questions you might have, especially if it's your first year or your first time back on campus - partly so I can be frank, I'm going to maintain anonymity, but otherwise glad to answer anything.","[""Recent grad here! I wrote [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/x0v2gx/a_letter_to_first_years_from_an_alum_1_year/) last week and I wanted to expand on, emphasize, or refute some points from a student's POV. Of course, I think the prof and I can both agree that we can't account for every major or student or experience.\n\nI majored in a branch of history and a branch of biology. No Rotman, cs, engsci experience.\n\n2. This is important for every student but ESPECIALLY for arts/humanities students. Taking a thesis/draft/outline of your essay is the only sure way you can reduce subjectivity in marking. Writing is an art but you need to keep practicing to be better and there is nothing better than accumulating tips from your profs who are world leaders in their field.\n\n4. I have to disagree with this: most students *are* aware that your earnings will drastically change depending on your discipline. From just my circle of friends, it looks like pure CS or CS + a different major made the most right out of the gates. Not sure about engsci but I'd assume they'd do well. For the rest of STEM/arts, it seemed pretty even (unless again, you had CS). It's good to have a general idea of what sector you want to work for post-grad but in this era, what you major in does NOT dictate what job you have.\n\nJob hunting during quarantine post-grad in a completely different city (Vancouver) where I had 0 connections was an interesting (aka ~~soul crushing~~) experience. But I ended up getting a job at a location I never dreamed of with my majors/experience (clinical trials at a major hospital in Vancouver). I'm sure luck was involved but talking to the physicians + now managers, they said I was a) really good at emphasizing my skills (skills I specifically developed at UofT (e.g. communication - writing, leadership - clubs, persistence - trying to get a 4.0 in this godforsaken school lol, flexibility - I had a variety of roles in a variety of ECs/clubs). I have 0 wet lab experience outside class labs (and even then, just first year labs) so if luck was involved, it was that they took a chance on me. However, they actually had a potential candidate already in mind (I was a late applicant), so I am inclined to believe that I interviewed well. Also, for my first year, I did not work in the same place for long and instead 'climbed' at every opportunity/job until I either got the pay that I wanted, or the role that would help me for med school. \n\nAlso: be flexible in the type of job you're searching for! This is extremely important because it'll be hard to get a specific job in a specific sector/discipline. Try to see if there are related jobs in the sector that you want OR look for jobs in sectors related to the one you're interested in. I was very flexible in my approach (ditched Indeed/Linkedin) and went directly to their website. Offered to fill temporary roles to get my feet through the door and the rest was history.\n\n5. My friends (UBC/McGill/UAlberta/Mac/Western grads) and I have all agreed that UofT is unique because it's almost like a pre-grad school, rather than an undergrad school. This is unsurprising because UofT's reputation comes from its research output. My profs for the most part were excellent *researchers*, but I can't say they were all excellent *teachers*. A lot of time on your own self-learning and being disciplined is absolutely required. By the time I was in third year, every evaluation was a final research paper, final research project, and the occasional exam. The + is that I think it sufficiently prepped me for the real world. The - is that YOU have to proactively chase down the opportunities. I always say UofT is like a mirror--it gives back exactly, if not a hair less than what you give it.\n\n**TL;DR: 9. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO!! NOT!! CHEAT!!!!!! If you got out of NOTHING else from this post, please just understand that UofT takes cheating far more seriously than any other university I've ever seen. You have to bring a fucking lawyer if you get caught. The 1 year + wait before your trial is fucking miserable. Understand what AOs actually are (it's more than just looking over a peer's shoulder during an exam or forgetting to cite). Most importantly, you can search up 'UofT Tribunal' to read every past case and what the miserable process looks like. IT IS MISERABLE. DO NOT CHEAT. LITERALLY JUST FAIL WITHOUT THE MISERY/SUSPENSION OR JUST GIVE THE BARE MINIMUM EFFORT TO AT LEAST GET A D OR SOMETHING. GO READ THE TRIBUNALS.**\n\n10. I slightly disagree with this. It is good for students to realize that university is not here to solve all your problems. Looking at it objectively, you're paying $8000 to just learn, not for a genie to solve your woes.\n\nHowever, university is in a really transitionary period in many peoples' lives. People go through so many unexpected things and I'm increasingly seeing that students do not expect the university to *solve* their issues, but they need help to try and make uni not *exacerbate* their issues. Having a shitty roommate or finding out the world has put to power another shitty politician isn't something university can solve, but I'd like to believe the students at UofTears are not (for the most part) infantile enough to believe professor john will fix his argument with his roommate. Instead, students often find themselves stuck in a loop with very little resources to break it. Take the roommate example: Jane has a nightmare roommate who parties constantly and you can't study or your things go missing or the constant stress is making Jane a suboptimal learner. It'd be crazy for Jane to expect Prof John to fix this issue--but rent in Toronto is absolutely crazy and finding an affordable space to live and feel safe in can be extremely challenging. If Jane does have the resources to move, she may ask Professor John for a 1 day extension while she moves her stuff/gets internet. This is an extreme example of course, but again, I don't think students expect the university to solve the 'little issues' in their lives. Instead, small things snowball or get caught in cycles that can really affect mental health--*especially* in a school as unforgiving, rigid, and lonely as UofT. That's how I constantly felt, anyways. And in case any prof/TA is reading thinking 'well learning to adapt and adjust is what you need for the real world,' I agree--but each student is different and so are their stories. To any of my profs who may, for some reason, be on Reddit reading this and they recognize my writing/post history: thank you so much for your understanding and flexibility over the years :D UofT is incredibly bureaucratic and rigid at times, but your flexibility gave me opportunities to learn about time management, what my limits were, the chance to actually hit my potential, and how I can be empathetic to the people I now serve.\n\n11. This is the only point I completely disagree on. Your TAs are still grad students at Canada's most prestigious university. They may not have the decades of experience but I've found them to be far better teachers, easier to approach, and they are neck-deep into research CURRENTLY. My fondest memories of being a student was watching TAs so passionately teach, and sitting down to listen about their research broadened my worldviews as well. All of my TAs were fantastic TEACHERS, rather than researchers. Research can come from other areas (UHN hospitals, school labs, etc.) but having an actually good teacher who is willing to sit down and instruct the materials is a game-changer. I would not be here had it not been for 3 TAs that helped my grades go from a 1.7 to a 4.0 thanks to their teaching abilities.\n\nThis is not to say that the professors here are bad or that they can't teach. Often, I find myself getting the basics down with TA-led classes. REALLY solid fundamentals. They actually TAUGHT me how to critically analyze things rather than just showing me with their research. Then, in my last 2 years when evaluations are research-based anyways, it was full-grind research with tenured profs. My humanities profs in particular, had mind-numbing theories and critiques about the world, and it was truly an inspiring journey--but it would've been useless had I not had TAs who a) could teach, b) were willing to answer so many questions on their own time, c) had a more 'fresh' memory of learning/teaching, d) didn't have outdated teaching mechanisms.\n\nI know this was long but this is a great post and I just wanted to contribute something! I'm in my post-grad blues now, missing UofT so much I'm thinking of transferring to one of the UHN hospitals :') Not every person I know loved it here or had as much of an enriching experience as I had, but to me, it was 5 years of immense stress, anxiety, pressure, but also of learning, developing innate abilities and fostering new ones, and new ways of understanding the world.\n\n**TL;DR: don't cheat. be flexible. give it your all and the university will often reward you back. have fun!**"", '[deleted]', 'Honestly, I need to disagree with point 11. Looking back at my undergrad, the best and most memorable courses were the ones taught by lecturers and sessionals. These people know how to teach. Research track profs just dump info on you and say, ‚Äúsuck it up and good luck‚Äù.  As a PhD student now, I am most grateful for learning HOW TO LEARN. As a PhD student, I get that info dump but now I know how to sift and go at it efficiently. If I wasn‚Äôt taught how to learn material (by phenomenal instructors) I would have had to learn it myself. Maybe I would, maybe I wouldn‚Äôt. So tldr, good instructors are ones that break down material in a logical way and structure their courses in a way that teaches students how to dive into information.  I think that is much more meaningful as a student. Google is free and research review papers exist. \n\nOh, and of course there are some research profs that are great instructors. Not talking in absolutes here :)', 'As someone with multiple advanced degrees (none from u of T)- number 11 is pretty much false. For first (or second year) courses you want people thag deeply enjoy teaching at a university level. Do they need to be on the bleeding edge for that? No way in hell. Of course for later year and grad courses, it‚Äôs paramount that you‚Äôre learning from those that are in the trenches (I am a biochemist, so I mean well\nFunded big labs with papers in Nature, etc. not folks who write BS review articles in the Canadian journal of biology or some other non impact journal).

Of course I‚Äôm asking about things beyond a high gpa and great writing skills. I really would appreciate your insight, thank u!', 'I‚Äôll be honest, point number 6 pissed me off. I commute an average of 3-3.5 hours a day to get to St. George, I am an executive with my student union, and I work a job‚Ä¶that doesn‚Äôt mean I enjoy doing this. It can be fun, but it‚Äôs also extremely stressful, time consuming, etc. This doesn‚Äôt even include working out, family commitments, etc. \n\nUniversities and university life treats commuter students like shit. Apologies that I do not want to pay 1,400-2,100 in rent alone, not including any other regular or emergency costs. Yes bank loans are an option, but why in the fuck are students who commute and cannot afford to live in Toronto expected to take out bank loans which will set them back with financial burdens. I have to take OSAP out for tuition and I still pay out of pocket. At least OSAP doesn‚Äôt ask me to pay during the school year. Bank loans on the other hand? Lol. Like, point number 6 only makes sense to anyone who commutes max. 30-60 minutes a day or lives near campus.\n\nAt Covenant House Toronto, a homeless shelter, a third of those seeking shelter are Post-Secondary students. Do universities care at all? No. But I guess point 10 tells me to suck it up and be an adult.

Cool, you‚Äôre being an adult, now get in line for an extremely long and expensive process (not including Meds). \n\nPoint is, your sixth point is extremely detached from reality. Commuter students would love to have the opportunity of living with their friends, go out clubbing without having to worry about the last train, bus, etc. and overall, enjoy their university experience like others, but, we can‚Äôt and we do our best to make it work.\n\nApologies in advance since I know what I just wrote is aggressive, but I needed to let this one out. Hopefully other profs see this too and hopefully universities become more accommodating to commuter students. As much as COVID sucked, online classes saved me.', 'Taking a world class education from the frontiers of research is overrated when the person explaining said concepts is poor at it and the economic results of said knowledge is negligible.\n\nUniversities should focus on hiring more teaching staff so students can have more solid foundations, as well as having smaller class sizes (by cutting the absurd enrollment rates) and ensuring the research track profs teach kids who are more or less guaranteed to be masters/ PhD. Or create some sort of pipeline (hint, hint, specialist degrees students).\n\nAny other opinion is hiding ones head in the sand from the calamity of underemployment and over qualifications we are creating.

I disagree with point 11 (sorry). The university hires sessionals because it is cheaper than hiring for a tenure-track position. Discounting these courses/instructors only adds to the culture of elitism so prevalent at UofT. If someone is a better instructor, you‚Äôll have a better experience in the class (and there‚Äôs plenty of peer-reviewed evidence to suggest better learning and outcomes as you‚Äôll be more engaged). I‚Äôd much rather have someone green who is enthusiastic about the material than someone who is teaching for the 20th time and more interested in their research than teaching. Look for instructors that are accessible, engaging, excited, and clear in their instruction. The first year is all about learning how to learn in that environment. Look for professors who will help distill the information into the most important pieces and help foster that skill. \n\nDecades out, I don‚Äôt remember every cutting-edge research finding. You know what I do remember?

You don‚Äôt need to be in the most research-engaged course all the time. Read course reviews, talk to other students, etc and find out who‚Äôs great. As an FYI, as you go through university, you‚Äôll have plenty of opportunity to be taught by research-track professors in upper-year courses. As you progress through the field, access to cutting edge research becomes more important. Seek out those profs in later years.\n\nOther points: - You‚Äôll meet some of the best people in the world here. You‚Äôll also encounter some incredibly cutthroat individuals. There can be tremendous competition at the university, as many people erroneously believe they are competing for the same opportunities (grad school, med school, internships). Be wary, but don‚Äôt be these people. Don‚Äôt crush others to get ahead. It sounds cliche, but it comes around.

I should also note that a lot of young people really only know the recent job market - the depths of Covid aside, the past half-decade has been one of the easiest times for grads to get a job in decades.  A friend of mine got a graduate degree with honors at Oxford in 2008 and the only job she could find in her field was as a temp hire in Saskatchewan!', ""Of course (hey, I did one of my degrees at night while I was working full-time, so I understand) - and the cost of living on or near campus is a burden more generally.

And I think it's well understood that this pattern is objectively worse at U of T than other Canadian campuses - it is partly a cultural pattern that developed on campus for reasons that I don't totally understand.  \n\nA related anecdote: I had an American friend up here recently who didn't believe there were over 60k students downtown because so many of the markers of that volume of students - the dive bars, the cheap restaurants, the music venues - are thin on the ground near U of T compared to much smaller universities."", 'Thanks for the response. Teaching at the frontier is definitely important but I have lack of anecdotal evidence that supports frontier researchers teaching frontier work in a way that actually makes sense. I find that frontier work is presented at the difficult level and few people can understand it without some help from a good teacher. \n\nI also agree that if the draw of UofT was the research and cutting edge work, then students should expect that. However, until your post I did not know that UofT had such a reputation. It is possible many students don‚Äôt know if this. \n\nRegardless, I appreciate your post. The tips are insightful and helpful. I‚Äôm glad that discussion was formed from your post.', ""I don't disagree at all with the sentiment, and definitely the modal sessional is a better teacher (or else they wouldn't be hired!).  But we actually have good research on this - the more research-active a professor is, the more likely they are teaching content at the frontier, and students objectively learn less from people with less experience teaching (esp. grad students).  From my perspective, the unique aspect at U of T among Canadian schools is the access to that frontier knowledge, so it's a bit of a shame to avoid interacting with it.\n\nI agree that there are plenty of faculty who are not clear or who mail it in, but I suspect the vast majority of us actually care about the quality of what goes on in the classroom."", ""Great question.  Of course, being able to write clearly is very important.  And the GPA is useful in getting through the door.  \n\nIn the academic sphere, do you mean as a professor?  In the humanities, you need a top PhD and a heck of a lot of luck - these fields do not hire many people because enrolment in the humanities has been falling for two decades.  \n\nElsewhere, I would suggest gaining some hard skills as well to differentiate yourself.  It is very hard for employers to evaluate young graduates.  Once you are on the job, you can of course always move up with hard work and talent.   The best first job is at a large organization where you can switch roles frequently early in your career - finding your niche where you like the job and can excel is really important, and hard to do at a smaller org.\n\nBtw, philosophy tends to have reasonably good job market outcomes, so I might separate that from the rest.

I was in a similar situation in undergrad and at the time I heard advice similar to OP. I get that someone from a privileged background just doesn‚Äôt understand how much harder the rest of us have to work just to go to uni. They mean well and it probably would be wonderful to live on campus and have all this down time to be social. But for anyone who is supporting themselves through school this is just not feasible. I took two buses everyday to get to school, had 3 pt jobs off campus and one on campus (to accumulate the hours), oh and a learning disability to add a cherry on top. I heard from so many of my peers that I needed to drop my jobs and focus more on school to do better, or go on the travel studies to build better connections and have fun, or that I needed to volunteer, etc to help me with pursuing further studies. I would have loved to have done all those things!!\nAt the time it annoyed me when I heard that kind of advice because I was just like ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt get it, do you?‚Äù  And I was right, they didn‚Äôt get, but it wasn‚Äôt their fault, my struggles were just way beyond anything they‚Äôve experienced. \nI thought about this and my peers were young and didn‚Äôt know much beyond their bubble. \n\nI know OP is a tenured prof and probably has encountered a good number of people with less privileged backgrounds. BUT in all fairness to OP, I‚Äôm not sure profs are very aware of their students struggles unless the students choose to disclose this information and most probably don‚Äôt - I know I haven‚Äôt. In four years of undergrad I only disclosed a bit of my background to 2 profs. One of them was because I almost failed a lab because I arrived late. I arrived late because I took two buses to go to school, one of them (the less freq one) broke and by the time they sent another to complete the route I was late. I explained the situation and asked if an email from the transit authority confirming that my route was affected on that day would suffice. To which he responded by asking why didn‚Äôt I drive instead of taking the bus since we can‚Äôt miss a lab. It took me a second to realize he wasn‚Äôt joking. I disclosed a bit of my financial struggles and he asked why not take an earlier bus. Again, I breathed in and out and responded that normally I would have arrived 15 min early to the lab if nothing had happened - which would be ok. And that since one of the buses only ran every 30 min, taking an earlier bus meant arriving 45 min early. For a test I would usually do this, but on a daily basis it simply didn‚Äôt work because I would have less down time and therefore it‚Äôd be harder to manage my jobs and everything else. \nI know most people get this, specially anyone who struggles financially.

The forefront of research lectures tend to be way out there for people who just finish high school. Perhaps this will be useful for the brightest in the class but that is not the goal for those intro classes in first year.', 'It is true that there is a large potential benefit to attending lectures from a ¬´\xa0research stream\xa0¬ª professor, but it isn‚Äôt guaranteed. Some of the worst professors I ever had were ¬´\xa0research stream\xa0¬ª professors. No matter how great the researcher, if they don‚Äôt want or can‚Äôt teach, then you‚Äôll have a miserable experience.\n\nMy advice to avoid that is careful planning and talking to older students. Older students know what professors are good and which will make you miserable. As for careful planning, if you do careful research, you can sometime predict who will teach what in the future and as such delay a course a bit to catch the right professor. You can‚Äôt always afford it, but sometime it is possible.', 'Hi- how do we network with our professors/TAs - what do smart introverts say?', 'You must‚Äôve had really shit profs because all my profs have been fairly understanding and accommodating.', ""The best studies here use grade cutoffs to look at the causal effect of college major on lifetime salary.  So, e.g., if a school requires an 80 to major in CS (in your first year, or in high school) and the next year it is 82, the students who have an 81.9 are basically the same as those with a 82.1, except the 82.1s are much more likely to major in CS.  Using this to study the lifetime pay of college majors more broadly, there is a massive gap.  Now, some of this may be because those folks who want to major in CS and had to major in art due to the grade requirement don't realize they would be good at coding software, and so never try.\n\nAn economist here wrote a nice summary of the evidence for the importance of major to salary.

What I mean is that my own classes were much worse when I was teaching as a grad student, because I simply didn\'t know enough to teach beyond the textbook.  I tried really hard, and prepped the classes to death, but in the end, you could have read books in the library and learned whatever I was teaching.  My classes now aren\'t like that - you\'re learning exactly the kind of things we talk about when we consult directly with industry and policymakers.  I suspect for a class where the content is fixed, like Intro to Calculus, I would just take the best teacher.  But for anything where the syllabus is designed by the professor, it is a huge mistake to take it from someone who is not aware of what is going on at the frontier of the field.\n\n(Incidentally, your view of academia is really field-specific.  In my area, no one cares one whit who my PhD advisor was or what the ""research lineage"" was.)', 'I don\'t really understand the pushback here. When I was a young grad student, I cared a lot and put a lot of work into my teaching also.

>This Tribunal has seen an alarming increase in spyware cases. This is some of the most egregious forms of cheating. It involves premeditation not only to hire the exam service, but to procure and wear the technology. It is pervasive and coordinated. This misconduct must be addressed, and the sanction must be serious to properly reflect the serious nature of the misconduct and to appropriately deter others. **In this case, but for the agreed statement of facts and joint submission on penalty, this Panel would have likely recommended expulsion**.

UofT has published a wave of academic offences, with most appearing to come from a specific demographic based on the names being blurred.

1606946830.0,"Entered UofT as a pre-med, got into CS post, now becoming a screenwriter: How I found my passion - or rather, how I got out of denial [LONG POST]","Hey everyone :D

This post is meant to outline my journey of exploring and ultimately finding the passion of my life. I hope it would make you even just a tiny bit more hopeful, knowing that you are never alone in your uncertainty. Please don‚Äôt hesitate to point out grammatical errors and typos!

So, how did everything happen?

From an early age, I have loved writing stories. In grade 4, I made a 250-page PowerPoint (I know it's funny xD) telling the story of two princess gal pals magicking their way out of an enchanted forest. I started writing novels at 12 (please don't ask me about them; they were so bad I can't even talk about without cringing). The longest piece I wrote in elementary school was around 130,000 Chinese characters (Yea, I'm Chinese btw).

If you asked the 12-yo me what I wanted to do as a grown-up, I would definitely say, ""A novelist!""

My mom's an engineer, and my dad's a surgeon. Since I was a little kid, they have been telling me that writing is not an ideal career. Well, I didn't need to hear from others to know the success rate is horrendous. They both wanted me to pursue a science career since I've always been good at physics and biology.

My become-a-novelist dream seemed completely shattered when I moved to Canada at 15. My English was so shitty back then I couldn't even understand my classmates half of the time. Writing in English seemed a dream completely out of reach.

It was then I fell in love with physics and psychology. Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time was the first book I ever read in English. I remember hiding under my duvet, reading with my phone's flashlight after lights out, so that the janitors at my super strict boarding school wouldn't confiscate the book. I remember perusing the pages of college psychology textbooks, marvelling at the impossibilities of the human mind, although I had to search up a dozen words and blatantly guess the meaning of another dozen for each page.

Then grade 12 hit. I developed a sudden interest in medicine, partially due to my dad's influence and partially because of Grey's Anatomy. Well, Grey's Anatomy had a greater influence. I worked hard, and U of T admitted me into its Life Science Stream.

During my first year as a pre-med at U of T, I found myself staying up late or even pulling all-nighters to write stories. The night before my BIO130 midterm, I said to myself, ""I'm just going to write a short paragraph and then off to sleep."" That paragraph quickly turned into a short story, and when I took another look at the clock, it was 5:30 in the morning. So, well, you could guess how that midterm went.  At the same time, I came to realize more and more that I didn't really want to be a medical doctor save a surgeon. Why? I wasn't sure.

During the second semester of my first year, I went out with a guy who was a CS student from Waterloo. He commented over some real tasty hot-pot that, ""You should try out computer science."" I, being a standard, what-should-i-do-if-i-cant-get-into-med-school lifesci, found the idea worth trying. I self-studied CSC108 and found programming fun, but what really drew me to CS was my first experience with virtual reality.

I'm not sure how many people don't know this, but as a U of T student, you can use the HTC Vive at Gerstein for free. I was immediately stunned by the possibility of living INSIDE a story world. Never before did we have the opportunity to interact with a story world in such an immersive way. I literally teared up over its beauty.

I thought to myself, ""I want to do VR. Or AR. Or whatever you call that thing that brings stories to life like never before.""

So, you guessed it; I worked my ass off for the CS PoST. I had never programmed or written even a single line of proof before. As an out-of-stream student without a VPN, I had to go to an internet cafe in the middle of the night to get past the Chinese firewall to enrol in CSC165. I pulled all-nighters for schoolwork for the first time in my life.

In my supplementary application, I wrote, ""I want to bring stories to life in the 21st century way.""

And I got in.

My initial plan was to get a Ph.D. and to do research in the field of VR. I then realized that this field is not what I had imagined. If I wanted to approach storytelling from a computer science perspective, I would most likely end up doing visual effects for movies, which is my least favourite part of any movie. During my PEY interviews this year, I was hit in the head with the realization that the field of computer science is fundamentally different from storytelling - sounds really obvious, but hey, I was very oblivious.

I began to question what I was doing all this time. After some sleepless nights and a lot of brooding anxiety, I finally put all the puzzle pieces together.

I thought I loved physics, but looking back, I was drawn to the contrast between the vast voidness of spacetime and the ephemerality of the human flesh.

I thought I loved medicine, but I was in fact stunned by the tragic beauty of mortality, the only thing all of us share as human beings. It was the cruel beauty of wishes unfulfilled, words unspoken, and wounds that would never heal. This explains why I only wanted to be a surgeon; they face extreme decisions with tighter time constraints than physicians, therefore the beauty is even crueller (please forgive me if this bit isn't accurate). 

I thought I loved psychology, but I was actually deeply touched by the intricacies of humanity itself. This explains why I had no interest in neuroscience; I found it too scientific and too ""solid"" to possess artistic beauty.

And even during the months in which I was desperate to get into CS PoST, I managed to read a dozen screenwriting books and wrote thrice as many pages of notes as I wrote for CSC165. I couldn't help writing scene analyses for my favourite movies, even when a problem set was due on the next day.

It turns out I have loved the same thing all along.

That realization was like a catharsis that brought tears to my eyes. I began to look for clues in my past (I'm aware of the confirmation bias, but), and everything just clicked.

I thought that I would never be as good as native English writers, so I kept pushing back reading books in English. I thought I would definitely starve as a writer, so I kept avoiding writing just to dodge my inner critic.

But hey, I would definitely regret not trying on my deathbed.

So I started reading. So I started writing. In a language that I used to, and probably still, suck at. In formats that I never thought I would encounter. I'm changing my program from CS specialist to CS major and adding a Creative Expressions minor and an English minor. I'm starting my first creative writing course in a month. I plan to write for VR. If this medium is too young, I'll write for tech-related TV shows and games.

And I must say, I have never been happier.

(P.S. I have to thank my friend K for all the wonderful help and reassurance along the way. I‚Äôm sure he will become a top physicist-philosopher of our time.)

1. If you know that you've been coughing for whatever reason, it's now common courtesy, and has been required in doctors offices before the pandemic, to wear a mask. Because whatever you're coughing out, it is going into somebody else's nose and mouth, in these close quarter classrooms.

2. If you can't or don't want to wear a mask, cover your mouth and your nose. Cough and sneeze into your arm or your hands -- if you have portable antibacterial to wash up afterwards.

3. Leave the classroom - hack and cough outside.

1547174684.0,To the guy in ESS205 who roasted the MindTap lady in lecture today,"My man, you're my goddamn hero lmao.


For those not in that class, what happened was that a representative from MindTap came to our lecture today to talk about it because quizzes we'd have to complete on it count for 25% of our final grade. However, the service costs ~64$ for a 12 month membership (even though the class is only 4 months long) or you could buy the access code + textbook for ~144$ (btw the textbook is the tiniest thing I've ever seen). This lady kept on emphasizing that UofT was getting a *special offer* and that 64$ is some sort of desirable discount. She went on to cite bullshit stats about how students who use MindTap perform better on tests than those who don't and some other propaganda. When the time comes for questions, this guy raises his hand and starts going offffff, saying that putting a grade behind a paywall is messed up and that the only reason that we're being forced to use it is because they're offering the prof some kind of compensation. At this point, people are cheering like crazy, the prof is hiding in the back of the room, and MindTap Lady keeps on repeating her mantra of ""64 doLLaRs iS a sPeCiaL diScOuNt foR uOfT sTuDeNts."" This encouraged other people to speak up and someone spoke against how we're being forced to pay for something that we'll only need for 3-4 months but need to buy a full year membership + a book that'll be useless at the end of the course (I'll let you guess how MindTap Lady replied). Honestly, I'm glad to see that people are fed up with this shit, especially after the post about micro transactions a few days ago. In one of my classes, my prof gives us online quizzes but just uses Quercus. It works perfectly fine and it's FREE. We're students already paying thousands in tuition money, I really don't want to spend more. ","['Putting grades behind a paywall is actually disgusting. The UTSU should be looking into this.

For about 50mins of our 2hr lecture, my prof was muted.  We tried EVERYTHING to get his attention including messaging the chat, sending emails, writing notes and holding it up to the camera‚Ä¶but he disabled the unmute function, so we couldn‚Äôt speak up.  We had to get another professor involved to finally bring it to his attention.
