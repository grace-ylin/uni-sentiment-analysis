10105,oh wow cheating has sure gotten more high tech,"DO NOT CHEAT, ESPECIALLY WITH SPY TECH, AT YOUR EXAMS",2025-03-27 03:48:52,UofT,Rant,"In UofT Tribunal's most recently-published [Academic Offence case #1695](https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/system/files/university-tribunal-decisions/Case%201695.pdf), the panel states:

>This Tribunal has seen an alarming increase in spyware cases. This is some of the most egregious forms of cheating. It involves premeditation not only to hire the exam service, but to procure and wear the technology. It is pervasive and coordinated. This misconduct must be addressed, and the sanction must be serious to properly reflect the serious nature of the misconduct and to appropriately deter others. **In this case, but for the agreed statement of facts and joint submission on penalty, this Panel would have likely recommended expulsion**.

UofT has published a wave of academic offences, with most appearing to come from a specific demographic based on the names being blurred. This is not to imply a stereotype, but the amount of cases I read on the Tribunal website puts a very bad picture on this demographic of students as UofT's efforts to mitigate cheating are not coming through to them.

Here is a list of **published** AO cases concerning this type of cheating:

\- **NEW:** [Case #1739](https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/system/files/university-tribunal-decisions/Case%201739.pdf): UTM student in their (supposedly) graduating semester was wired with spy tech including ear pieces for an ECON exam. Suspended for 5 years.

Suspended for 5 years.

\- [Case #1653](https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/system/files/university-tribunal-decisions/Case%201653.pdf): UTSC student used a hidden ear piece at an exam in Winter 2024. Paid $1000 for cheating services and was part of a group chat. Suspended for 5 years.

\- [Case #1651](https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/system/files/university-tribunal-decisions/Case%201651%20%281%29.pdf): UTSC student used a hidden ear piece and hidden camera from a button on her clothes. Recommended for expulsion.

26030,i am a grade student going to university next year any word on if i qualify as i will be going to a post secondary institute september,The Canadian Government announces the Canada Emergency Student Benefit. All students and recent graduates (2019) will receive $1250\month if making less than $1000\month.,2020-04-22 15:34:15,UofT,Finances,"This was just announced by the government. 

Read about it here:

https://beta.ctvnews.ca/national/canada/2020/4/22/1_4906564.html

It will run from May to August 2020.

The total cost of this welfare program will be $9B.

The Government will also double the Canada Student Grant by $3000. 

Edit:

#FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:

*I preface this FAQ by saying that details are evolving as we go, and this program is not official legislation. The program may change in the final legislative draft and law. This is based on the information that has been released so far on April 22nd, 2020.*

**Who qualifies?**

Based on government sources, you qualify if:

(a) You are a student that will return to school in the Fall of 2020, or

(b) You have graduated, or will graduate in 2020.

and will make less than $1000/month from the months of May to August.

**Can international students apply for this benefit?**

CTV News reports:

>The new funds will be available for Canadians studying in Canada, as well as students who are completing postsecondary schooling abroad, her office clarified. Non-citizens, such as international students, cannot claim the emergency benefit.

Permanent Residents are, however, reportedly eligible.

**Can high school students going into university apply for this benefit?**

There are no firm details on this yet. Some journalists (CBC) are saying that incoming first-year students will qualify.

**Can part-time students apply for this benefit?**

Yes, part-time students can apply.

**How much is the monthly benefit?**

The monthly benefit is $1250/month for eligible students, and $1750/month for students with disabilities or eligible dependents. It will run from May 2020 to August 2020.

**Where do I go to register/apply for this benefit?**

There are no firm details yet. However, the government has said this benefit will be administered through the CRA. This likely means one way to apply will be via the online My CRA account. You can register for a My CRA account [here.](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html) 

**When can I apply for this benefit?**

The program is still not official law. Therefore, the government does not have the program ready yet. Expect to hear more details on when you can apply in early May. In the meantime, make sure you have a My CRA account.

**Do I need to have had a job lined up for the summer to qualify?**

No, you don't need to have had a job or lost your job. If you are a post-secondary student, you can apply.

**Can I still work and apply for this benefit?**

Yes, you can still work and receive the benefit provided that you do not make more than $1000/month.

**What if I am earning a stipend or working via NSERC this summer?** 

This is still unclear. There are no firm details. It will all depend on the definition of ""income"" in the legislation. It may only include employment and/or business income (like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit), and not other forms of non-taxable income like scholarships, stipends or research grants.

**Do I have to have worked last year in the summer to get the benefit?**

No, there is no current 2019 income threshold or work requirement to get this benefit.

**I collect $2,000 a month from the CERB. Can I also collect this benefit?**

No. You either claim the CERB or the CESB, but not both in the same time period.","['grade', 'student', 'going', 'university', 'next', 'year', 'word', 'qualify', 'going', 'post', 'secondary', 'institute', 'september']",,0.0,grade student going university next year word qualify going post secondary institute september
20492,reach out to your academic counselor op and escalate this kind of petty revenge bullshit is not acceptable,Steer clear of CDN355 with Siobhan O'Flynn; she'll drag your grades down even if you do nothing,2024-05-15 19:54:00,UofT,Courses,"Here's the situation. The first assignment in this class was a 15% short essay. Siobhan O'Flynn gave me a passing score, saying my grade was significantly reduced because one paraphrase wasn't the original author's viewpoint.

Of course, I believed the original author expressed the viewpoint, so I sent a Quercus inbox message explaining this (she said she would respond much slower compared to email, very old-school). I didn't include one word of a regrading in the message at all, just clarification. In the message, I quoted the original text and provided more detailed reasoning. However, after reading the message, the professor lowered my grade to 40%.

This in itself is outrageous: without any changes to the assignment, simply because a student tried to explain, the professor lowered the grade from passing to failing.

But it doesn't end there; within 40 minutes, my grade was further reduced to 30%, and during that time, I did nothing, and the original submission didn't change at all.

I believe that if a professor has such power, simply shutting students' mouths and giving them 0 would be better. I believe students have the right to explain their motivation in their work without fearing their marks being taken away.

Furthermore, the grading scheme and project instructions are unclear, even though she can talk about them for more than 2 hours each class(rambling); also, she asks students to sign an academic integrity statement at the beginning of the term and once for every subsequent assignment, which is unnecessarily stupid. I can't believe someone is still doing this in 2024, requiring a total of 5 academic integrity checklists for one class.

In summary, avoid this professor.

Lastly, the course itself seems decent; it has no tests or exams and will cover data visualization and practical chart tools later on.

# Update as of May 16, 2024, 12:34 AM EDT:

Originally, I just wanted to share my story and help other people who want to select CDN355 in the future, since I didn't find much information about the professor and the course, and I'm not responsible for providing evidence. But now there are requests for posting copies. I can still take screeshots since there is a delay before the course content becomes invisible for me on Quercus. I believe that providing more necessary content would help, so I'll do this. I removed parts where it would be inappropriate to post here.

I also posted those redundant academic integrity checklists. However, posting the essay, rubric, and syllabus would violate school policy, so I won't do it.

Academic integrity checklists

The way she insists on her holy highest academic standards may be a better fit for an essay lawyer than a teacher. I believe that even someone who wrote a 3-page essay with random opinions, citing only 1 sentence from each source she provided, would receive a grade higher than 30%. She should reduce the distance between herself and her students, not just in the news (what she tried to do. I saw pictures of her standing alongside students in several news articles).

Aside from this point, some comments mentioned that Rate My Professor website is unreliable and provided a link to prove it (with a low-score professor's research). RMP scores would be another debate, but it's just a simple mention here. While I think its anonymity may introduce bias, much like the internet, it's a platform for students to provide opinions, and it's understandable that a bad professor would not be happy with it (who has a very low score). I just want to ask: would any of you, as a genuine student, prefer a professor rated 2.1/5.0, 2.8/5.0, or even as high as 3.5/5.0 over those higher than 4? Would you choose a professor with low ratings, not drop the course, and not use CR/NCR, believe in your extraordinary strength to earn a fair grade from any grader and to have a pleasant class experience?

# Update as of May 16, 2024, 2:25 PM EDT:

There are so many comments going on now; I read them and couldn’t get back to each one of them, but I appreciate your concerns and advice. I have received updates from at least four other students who are currently enrolled in the class and are experiencing difficulties with her.

Here’s the quote from one of the classmates:

“When I asked her to clarify the assignment requirements, she scolded me. But when some classmates asked her anonymously, she pretended to be very patient in her responses. When I asked her a question via email, she didn't answer it. But when someone else asked the same question in class, she said, ’Oh, I just noticed this, thank you.’

For the assignment, there was no problem with my citations, and she didn't give any constructive feedback on what I did wrong; she just insisted that my ideas were problematic. She always runs over time in class, claiming it's office hours, but during office hours, she talks about techniques needed for the final. She shouldn't be in academia; she should be an actress.”

Another student received low marks on the essay and unconstructive feedback such as only “vague statements.” There have already been 14 people dropping out in just a few days, the full capacity of this class is 36.

Since it’s not only my problem here, I feel bearing a responsibility to push this thing further. I sent an email to the Woodsworth Registrar, and they replied that they can issue a full refund for the course, but I don’t care about that now. I already saw someone suggest going to the department chair and even the dean’s office, and I am doing this. This thing had filled my mind; I was very awake and couldn't sleep well last night. I'm doing something that I have never done before.

If someone sees this and is currently enrolled in this class, just email the department or registrar; it will help.

This is the passage I just found on the UofT website, just to let students know their rights. The formal process is that even if you have plagiarized, the professor cannot impose a penalty. This official passage just defines her conduct as violating the policy.

# Update as of May 17, 2024, 1:58 AM EDT:

I have just finished sending the email to the vice-dean (it was long, I hope I can sleep better today) and noticed that a commenter suspected to be O'Flynn appears:

https://preview.redd.it/cr1zbfe6ex0d1.png?width=1182&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4ebab1b2178b9c974340da55aa8d4e9e7d6ad45

After hearing about more difficult times experienced by other students with her, I simply don't want to argue with such a hilarious statement. Hi, O'Flynn, do you think people care about your A in the course like you care about your director title? Accusing someone of helping others of whining is almost as stupid as saying that people go to university solely to get As in their courses. Oh, yeah, you might have just made discriminatory remarks about high school students.

# Update as of May 20, 2024, 11:55 AM EDT:

It turns more obvious now.

Another classmate from CDN355 messaged me today. Siobhan O’Flynn didn’t even finish reading her essay, missed the classmate’s citation, and claimed that she plagiarized. The classmate sent a long email to Siobhan O’Flynn to explain, but Siobhan O’Flynn neither listened to nor trusted her. After dropping CDN355, Siobhan O’Flynn threatened her by saying, “You have to finish the rest of the assignments whether you dropped the course or not” (not the original quote).

This time, Siobhan O’Flynn didn’t lower the mark but sent the assignment to the academic unit after the classmate dropped the course. Clearly, she now knows not to penalize students privately; this is tantamount to admitting that she violated the policy in my case. I confirmed with the classmate that she did not plagiarize.

The slots are now 15:

https://preview.redd.it/cxn203zmvl1d1.png?width=1774&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bc7e5cfa18933b3058b23e70f737ece05e10556

At this point, I suggest that everyone enrolled in CDN355 drop the course. There is no value in keeping it. Today is the last day to drop a course with a 75% refund. You can ask your College Registrar for a 100% refund by telling them what Siobhan O’Flynn has done.

I sent an email to the academic unit notifying them of what O’Flynn has done to help that classmate. I also received an email from the vice-dean stating that I will hear from him in the coming days, so there should be results this week.

One of my RMP ratings got deleted, I guess it's because someone reported it. Some comments in my thread seem to have an unchangeable standpoint rather than being reasonable; just feel them:

Vice-Dean Randy Boyagoda just replied to me this morning, basically saying he had a talk with Siobhan O'Flynn and is satisfied with her plan for continued teaching. As far as my case goes, I guess that will be it.

One last thing I want to say is that I am probably the first person who drew the faculty's attention to Siobhan O'Flynn. If anyone in the future sees this thread and encounters difficulties with her, it will be a lot easier for you to send emails to the school to report her (for example, in BMS100 next semester; I would suggest not taking her classes). I believe if that really happens, she will face more serious consequences.","['reach', 'academic', 'counselor', 'op', 'escalate', 'kind', 'petty', 'revenge', 'bullshit', 'acceptable']",,-0.8794,reach academic counselor op escalate kind petty revenge bullshit acceptable

The rodents at UBC must also be really fat right? They're feasting on the scraps left by students everyday, but I'm a little concerned whether or not it would be safe to eat them as I do not know what exact kind of garbage is nourishing them because UBC is a big place with many students who are not exactly known for making good decisions. I am also not very sure what kind of the ecological impact introducing a new predator (myself) would have on the ecosystem.

The reasoning is simple. Without a megathread, /r/UBC would be flooded with nothing but questions that apply to only a small percentage of the UBC population.

**Examples of questions that belong here**

- comparing courses or instructors
- asking about how hard an exam is
- syllabus requests
- inquiries about majors, programs, and job prospects
- ""what-to-do if I failed/was late/missed the cutoff""

**What you don't need to post here**

- **Post-exam threads** (ex. 'How did you find the Birb 102 midterm)
- rants, raves, shout-outs or criticisms of programs. 
- Other content that is not a question/inquiry

**Process**

- It might take up to 4 hours for your post to be approved (except when we're sleeping). 
- Suggested sort is set to new, so new comments will always be the most visible.

68017,you forget the nearest testing location is like a min bus from ubc and costs like no wonder theres only cases no university student has the time or money to go get tested especially during finals and especially if you live on campus,"To anyone showing up sick for exams, I don't blame you.",2021-12-15 19:49:43,UBC,,"Please read before you get upset.

I take COVID very seriously. I've known people who have died from COVID. It is very serious, very real, and potentially deadly.

With the new Omicron variant going around, I understand why so many student's are pushing for online exams. I am too. We're pushing a lot of blame towards the heads of UBC, and while we have every right to be upset with them, our professors have a say in this too. In one of my piazza classes' when a student asked what to do if they don't feel comfortable coming to in person exams, the professor replied with ""you can bring your own hand sanitizer, and wash your hands before and after."" I'm sorry but what the actual fuck.

If you're sick or test positive for COVID, the only option is to wait like 4 months to do it deferred. For people who have already put in the money for tutoring, spent the past month prepping for this exam, and taken the time off, this makes zero sense. I don't understand why it's so difficult to give students an online option to prevent sick people showing up to exams. And to the sick people showing up, I don't blame you, nor am I upset with you! It's not your fault you've been put in a tricky position. I'm ashamed to say that I would do the same.

UBC professors who may see this, give students the option of online exams! You can enforce different policies for the online exams, such as no bell curving, less time, camera must be on, etc to prevent cheating. At this point, it seems as though UBC cares more about convenience than preventing sickness.

UBC res sent out emails this morning saying they're providing more rapid testing - but guess what, that isn't going to do anything!! If people weren't getting tested before, they aren't going to get tested now. And even if they are, they'll do it after the exams. I was considering getting tested today, just to ensure I'm not carrying anything before entering a room full of 800 people, but then I was struck with the realization that if it's positive, I won't be able to attend exams. I'm getting tested after exams before seeing my family for the holidays.

Anyways, feel free to downvote into oblivion, I made a new account for this post. I'm just so upset about the whole situation. Also, to the people saying the people who want online exams just want to cheat... sure maybe there's a few. I'm fully studied and prepared for every one of my exams, but I am not prepared for the additional anxiety of sitting beside people who are coughing up phlegm <3","['forget', 'nearest', 'testing', 'location', 'like', 'min', 'bus', 'ubc', 'cost', 'like', 'wonder', 'there', 'case', 'university', 'student', 'time', 'money', 'go', 'get', 'tested', 'especially', 'final', 'especially', 'live', 'campus']",,-0.0772,forget nearest testing location like min bus ubc cost like wonder there case university student time money go get tested especially final especially live campus

108235,maybe you should review your own expectations,"I am so mad at profs who are like ""I only give A's very exceptionally, and only for perfect work"". (Arts)",2020-11-03 16:18:09,McGill,,"Like what in the flying hell is ur point as a professor if that's the case? An A is 85%, which is nowhere near perfect. If ur a prof reading this, and most of your students are regularly getting C's and you take pride in giving out only the very rare occasional A, why?

1) Why make it that much harder to get a good grade during a pandemic, at an already difficult as all hell school?

2) You, as a prof, are failing your students. You are doing something wrong. You are here to enrich the students learning experiences, and enable them to get the best grade possible. So if your students are constantly getting C's with no improvement cuz you have some stupid idea of 'average', YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING WRONG. You are failing at teaching, and you should not be proud of that. A C is 5% away from failing. At this point, it looks like you're just giving everyone C's to make sure you have enough people that pass the class. Everybody being 5% from failing is NOT AN ACHIEVEMENT, PROFESSOR. It is literally the biggest failure that, you, as a professor, can achieve. Why? Because you're LITERALLY FAILING AT TEACHING. 

Sincerely,
A really, really, fed up Arts student.

99020,buy some n masks for them here asappray for them,To all McGillians from China,2020-02-01 00:36:04,McGill,,"Tbh these days I just don’t have the passion for studying. My life has been in a passive circle ever since the coronavirus outbreak happened in China half a month ago. The very first thing I see every morning is the notification of new deaths happened over night. MY whole family lives in the very center of  Chongqing, a city among top five of the cities with the most ppl infected. Now the holiday is almost over and my parents have to go to work in very few days but they still haven’t been able to buy enough face masks for themselves and my younger brother studying in a local boarding school. I just can’t stop worrying all of my families and friends all the time. It’s not only me, but also almost every Chinese I know, including my roommate from Guangdong, who hasn’t been sleeping in a few days. However, I don’t think McGill is fully aware of what Chinese McGillians are going through. McGill is already pretty stressful, and all these pressure and worries just make it worse. So here I’m calling to ask for McGill university to provide additional emotional support opening to all students who think they have been affected by coronavirus outbreak. Anyone who thinks additional emotional support is a necessary measure can just like or leave a comment under this post to show your support. Moreover, I do hope everyone who sees this post and their families and friends can make through this hard period. I do understand the first month is this new decade has been tough, but as long as we stick together it will end up just fine.

As the title suggests, I applied to, and was rejected from, U of T this year. And I have not been taking it fantastically, to say the least. I was hoping posting here and getting all of my thoughts out would allow me to finally move on, so here you go.

Throughout my life I (like many of you, probably) have been fed the notion that hard works pays off. That putting in the effort, giving things your all, will open doors for you and result in a positive outcome. Now, you see, it's not that I bought into this 1000% -- I didn't think that working hard meant one was entitled to whatever they wanted/were working for. But I did believe, to some extent, that if I worked really hard and gave school and extracurriculars my 110%, I would have my pick of Ontario University programs.

I was wrong.

After four years of trying my absolute hardest, I was rejected from the only program I actually wanted to go to-- the only one I could truly see myself in: UofT CS (did you guess it?). And it hurt. So much. You see, I don't think it would have been so bad if I didn't put so much effort in in high school to mitigate this exact situation (getting rejected from my dream program). First of all, I took a much more difficult course load in high school than I needed to. I purposely selected the hardest classes my school offered as to best prepare myself for success in university. While my friends were taking classes like nutrition and leadership, and having a spare, I was grinding, thinking for sure that it would pay off. Second, I was putting in a lot of effort in all my classes. I finished grade 11 with a 99.4% average (top 8) and grade 12 with a 99.0% (top 8) despite having a couple really tough teachers. I got 6-7 awards at grad including highest overall average. Finally, I was trying my very best to have impressive extracurriculars -- I basically said yes to every opportunity that presented itself. I joined teams and clubs at my school (including ones I started myself), competing sometimes at the provincial level, I worked and volunteered, I was selected for leadership roles in my community. I really thought I was going to get in. So did my friends, and my parents, my guidance counsellor, teachers, family, people I volunteered for and worked with... I felt so ashamed when I got rejected. I still do, actually. I only ever told my parents (and you now I guess).

What made it worse too, I think, is the amount of time and effort I put into deciding, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that UofT CS was the absolute best place for me. I did SO much research. I mean **SO** much. I've been researching programs and universities seriously since before I started high school. Since I've always been interested in everything, it took a lot of research and introspection to determine what I really wanted to do and where. But after countless hours and considering so many factors, I decided on UofT CS. I was so excited about the program and the school. Every single day I would watch students' youtube videos and check the reddit admissions thread. I don't think I'd ever been this excited about anything.

Anyway, I've just been kind of grieving for the last several weeks. It honestly does feel like a loss. I'm not sure exactly of what though... maybe the person I thought I would be? The life I expected to have? It seems so silly and ridiculous to be this upset about it / to have not moved on. I know I have to move on. I will. I know that my broken mentality is just going to doom me to a self-fulfilling prophecy of being unhappy and unsuccessful at the university I will be attending next year. It's tough to let go of a dream though, you know?

I do know one thing for sure: my inability to healthily manage this rejection probably means that I really, *really* needed it. I cannot go through life becoming depressed and disheartened when things don't go my way. As cliche as it is, that's life. You can do everything right (or not), and things can still go wrong. Things *will* go wrong. A lot. And oftentimes, you cannot prevent this; you can only change how you respond. And, sometimes, it feels like you can't even do that. But you can sure as heck try, which is what I'm doing right now.

TL;DR: I got rejected from my dream program. I'm sad about it. But I will be ok. I will be great.

If you've bothered to read this monstrosity (which I'm very much hoping doesn't sound like a whiny entitled teen complaining (but now realizing it probably does -- sorry)) I suppose I should share with you some sort of lesson or takeaway from all of this--

High school lurkers (I know you're here.. I was one of you for a few years): A portion of this post might seem like I'm saying that you shouldn't work hard and just give up. That's not it. To be honest, if I knew I wasn't going to get into UofT CS, or any program, I don't think I would have changed anything. Although the high grades and the university acceptances and the awards are nice, believe it or not, they're not the reason to try you best -- there is some other intrinsic benefit to giving something your all, that is very difficult to explain, but that means more than the external stuff (imo, anyway). What I *am* saying, though, is don't make decisions, and especially not sacrifices, off of assumptions. Things like if this, then this. If I work hard, then I will get accepted into my desired program and be happy. Because life never works like that. Be prepared for things to not work out sometimes. It's ok if they don't.

I've been thinking about this TikTok I saw a while back -- ""Remember to not work too hard today - Justin worked hard and still didn't become the family wizard."" Clearly this is a joke but I think there is some truth behind it too. It's been a while since I've seen the movie, but if Justin worked hard and made the sacrifices and decisions he did solely to become the family wizard, it would hurt a lot if he didn't get it. However, if he also worked hard for himself and the intrinsic benefit, it would still all (or largely) be worth it.

Current UofT students: I don't want to sound like a patronizing high schooler, because I know I am lacking in life experience, but if there is one thing I can leave you with it is that you are so much more than your academics and success. I'm sure you've heard this before, as I have, but I never *truly* believed it. At some level I still tied my grades to my self-worth. Please don't let it affect your view of yourself if you have a bad test, a bad class, or even a bad year. I let it affect my view of myself when I got rejected and it was terrible. I know it helps to have other things going on like spending a decent amount of time on extracurriculars and relationships, so that school doesn't become your whole life.

And to everyone: Firstly, please be sensitive to other people. I remember right when I started to get over the rejection, I told someone I just met where I was going (they asked) and, without missing a beat, they said ""Why not UofT?"" I know they didn't mean any harm but that comment did a lot of damage. You never know what's going on in people's lives.

Second, the ability to productively cope and deal with misfortunes, rejection, and other unfortunate circumstances is massively undervalued in our society. I'm glad that, at the very least, this rejection has helped me develop this skill a little bit and prepare me for the inevitable *next time*.

TL;DR2: Life goes on.

Thanks everyone,

86336,yeah some opinions are wrong but if people cant say them out loud they cant be counter argumented,Speaking Our Minds at McGill,2023-10-05 17:08:21,McGill,," I'm a liberal Poli Sci student. I've written this post because I don't feel like I can speak my mind at McGill. 

What I've realized is that there is a lot of dogmatism on this campus, particularly concerning issues of social justice. Critiquing any progressive ideas can prompt accusations of bigotry, insensitivity, or even violence. It's easy not to notice this dogmatism because dissent has been discouraged, making some ideas about social justice appear self-evident. 

To be clear, I'm not a far-right wingnut. I'm a democratic socialist who wants an end to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. But I'm also alarmed by the stifling intellectual environment surrounding social justice at McGill. Enforcing ideological purity by shaming dissenters is something I'd expect to come from the far-right, not left-wing McGillians. 

All of the unproductive behaviours I will identify in this post are things I have been personally guilty of. By writing this post, I hope to draw attention to a problem I am partly responsible for.

I've spoken to many left-wing McGillians who feel they can't speak freely about certain progressive ideas, for fear of being labeled bigots. Here are some examples:

* Women who think that aspects of the MeToo movement are overblown or unproductive
* Professors who think that progressive ideas about mental health have created a culture of self-victimization and learned helplessness
* Black students who disagree with elements of recent anti-racist ideas; feel uncomfortable around many progressive white students because they try to acknowledge blackness instead of acting colourblind
* Queer students who feel uncomfortable in the LGBTQ+ movement because of its lack of ideological diversity and expectations surrounding dress, appearance, and tone of voice
* Students who have experienced rape, sexual assault who think that the current approach to sexual violence worsens mental health outcomes
* Science students who are alarmed by the anti-scientific attitudes of some left-wing McGillians, who deny any scientific facts that could potentially be abused for right-wing purposes (such as existence of human nature and innate aggregate sex differences between men and women)
* Liberal students and professors who are concerned about the state of free speech on campuses, but don't want to be seen as right-wingers

These people only shared their views after I made it clear that I wouldn't shame them for their opinions. By approaching political conversations more openly, I realized that many left-wing McGillians disagree with certain progressive ideas, but don't feel comfortable saying so. 

All of this is bad for three reasons. Firstly, we need open discourse in order to expand our minds. Listening to the people who disagree with us, instead of assuming they are bigots because we don't like their views, is a great way to sharpen our political thinking. A broadened perspective is one of the main rewards of a university education, but the current intellectual environment is robbing many of us of this benefit.

Secondly, freedom of speech is important in itself. It's necessary for democracy and good citizenship. How can we properly debate the social and political issues that affect our society if we routinely shame dissenters? Many of the ideas that we consider fundamental to the wellbeing of our society now were controversial a short time ago. 

Finally, closed intellectual environments harm social justice movements, in two ways. Firstly, shutting down dissent alienates potential allies. Shaming others for disagreeing with us is profoundly obnoxious. It communicates moral arrogance and makes others feel unheard and aggrieved. There is a reason the far-right has seized on the issue of free speech on campuses. They know that our approach to speech we disagree with is deeply unpopular.

Secondly, treating progressive ideas as sacrosanct allows bad ideas to flourish, undermining the efficacy of social justice activism. Activists in this environment become less capable of communicating effectively with the public, since their ideas are tailored to people who already agree with them.

I'm confident that leaving space for disagreement would raise the quality of discourse, broaden the minds of students, and strengthen social justice activism. Restoring intellectual openness would benefit all of us. Let's create a campus where we can speak our minds.

87289,lol dude we are on the same page this winter will be my th semester,I graduated McGill with a 2.34 GPA! AMA,2021-12-26 03:21:57,McGill,,"Hi fellow McGillians,

During my ten semesters at McGill, I struggled A LOT - mental health issues, interpersonal issues, imposter syndrome... you name it. As you can see in [the graph here](https://imgur.com/HRMb50c) (made for your amusement), I finished my first semester at McGill with a 0.58 term GPA. I went through the readmission process twice, failed/incompleted more than 10 courses, and spent many semesters on academic probation. After five years, I barely graduated by the skin of my teeth.

I wanted to make this post to remind fellow struggling students that there is more to life than a perfect GPA. No, I likely won't be able to go to grad school in the near future, but I managed to land an interesting job in my field of study that pays well and offers a relatively good work-life balance. Not everyone at McGill is going to go to the ivies for grad school, and that is okay.

I never told a single person just how badly I was fucking up, and felt so alone/guilty throughout my  whole tenure at McGill. I'm making this post to enable an open dialogue for students that don't feel they're succeeding at McGill. I'm proof that there is more to life than your undergrad GPA. Feel free to ask me anything - tips on how to pick yourself up, best study spots, how to get a job with a shitty GPA - I'm an open book (or PM me!).

I am trying to shed some light on the current situation in Orchard Commons. We continue to have large parties in our buildings, putting the safety of residents and staff in jeopardy. Athletes continue to host and attend large parties, both against the provincial COVID-19 orders and UBC Housing rules. 

* Men's and Women's Track and Field/Cross Country has had parties of 15+ people this week with no masks
* Women's Hockey also is holding and attending large parties within our building.

With the P1 variant, we need to take additional precautions. These two teams have shown blatant disregard and/or do not care.

I suggest that these teams are removed from Orchard Commons as they pose a dangerous threat to the rest of us, students. Coaches should remove these students from all practices and games (if they are happening) because they now threaten infecting other athletes. UBC administration should investigate these incidents, and all students who attend a large gathering (15-20+ people) should receive non-academic misconduct penalties.

Follow the rules, please.

107889,hi there sorry given the number of issues i had im keeping this information private,Yet another sad story from an int'l grad student,2022-03-08 16:44:47,McGill,,"Here is my sad story as a grad student at McGill - maybe other international students might get something out of it. Apologies for the very negative tone.

Context: I'm an international student from ""one of those developing countries"" out there, as people here told me once. I completed my undergrad and had to go to the industry for a few years (into STEM). Then I got an MSc, published a paper and started to prepare an application for McGill's PhD program. I made it! I joined a lab I deeply admired.

As I moved to Montreal and started my semester, I realized some things would be harder than I expected (covid was not here yet): I'd have 3 years to take 8 grad courses, TA every semester (to make 630 CAD) and my tuition fees were not covered. The stipend I got later (\~25K) would be nearly entirely for the tuition fees (\~23K). I thought I could keep a part time job on top of this workload. Heh.

Red flags for the lab came fast: the week I arrived, another grad student was leaving McGill after a severe discussion with the PI (it was all before covid). Then the pandemic hit us all, and, while losing relatives and friends without being able to travel anywhere, I went over multiple unpleasant events at the lab: ppl yelling at me multiple times, being targeted with racist jokes, etc. The worst part is that I was not allowed to do research on the topic I wanted. Claiming I was ""intellectually limited"", prof assigned me to a project which was not under they domain, but they had to publish to meet the requirements of a grant. I was not allowed to have collaborators outside my lab. Anyway, this post is not about this problematic behaviour of this lab.

It took me time to leave. I finally made it out in my 3rd semester. I thought the department would be supportive, but no. They gave me a deadline to find another supervisor. I'd also be forced to switch areas entirely. Sadly, I did not find any other prof to support me through the PhD. The department ""kindly"" reminded I'd be kicked out and I'd need to leave the country. In the middle of a pandemic. ""You'll need to go back home"", they said. I don't have a home anywhere else. Without other options, I had to leave the PhD program and switch to the MSc program - and continue paying these bloody tuition fees.

To bring some light to this sad narrative, I ended up joining a lab where the prof allowed me to do research on the topic I wanted to, even though it's not their area of expertise. Even though I have no labmates, nor ppl to talk to, I am still very thankful for the opportunity they gave me. This was one of my very few nice experiences here.

From the last paragraph, you may think this is yet another story with a happy conclusion. It isn't. My dream to pursue a PhD in this domain is dead (my records got 'dirty' after leaving a PhD program; other institutions won't take me. Plus, it's a relatively small community and people know my previous advisor). McGill took away my confidence, energy and money (I understand the pandemic made everything worse. Now, there is a war: we don't have a moment to breathe, eh?).

International students: watch out, especially if you didn't complete your undergrad here. The work load is unsustainable: 8 courses (you may get a course reduction in some cases; I did and went from 8 courses to 7), 3 years to complete your PhD (that was fixed on my letter), 25K stipend \*not\* covering your int'l tuition fees, TA'ing every semester for 630 CAD... There are some scholarship opportunities (I got one from the department for my 3rd semester, but then I had to leave the program as I described previously), but they are far more limited. Working off-campus is challenging, since we're limited to 20h. Many companies won't take part-time (very true for some branches of STEM).

Also, do not let people treat you poorly just because of the place you come from. And don't rely on the administration either. They may not help at all.

I had no friends around. I still don't; everyone is much younger than me. My only support came from the therapists at McGill. 

Lastly, I'm sharing this story because I found out other students are going through similar issues. I am sorry. If anyone is in the same boat, reach out.

I am glad this all is coming to an end.","['hi', 'sorry', 'given', 'number', 'issue', 'im', 'keeping', 'information', 'private']",,0.0,hi sorry given number issue im keeping information private

1. If you know that you've been coughing for whatever reason, it's now common courtesy, and has been required in doctors offices before the pandemic, to wear a mask. Because whatever you're coughing out, it is going into somebody else's nose and mouth, in these close quarter classrooms.

2. If you can't or don't want to wear a mask, cover your mouth and your nose. Cough and sneeze into your arm or your hands -- if you have portable antibacterial to wash up afterwards.

3. Leave the classroom - hack and cough outside.

Want to go to class? You can. Want to stay at home all semester? You can. Snow storm? Attend class from home. Sick? Attend class from home. 

The push for hybrid learning was happening even before COVID. Look at the digitization efforts in libraries, archives, and education in general. Increasing ways to access education and information is a GOOD thing - why is this being met with adversity from some students and professors? As students, we should ALL be in favour of hybrid learning; and for professors, the only reason to be against hybrid learning is because it is challenging to incorporate two modes of teaching into a class. But when did something being difficult mean that it shouldn’t be done (especially when it it is in the interest of all students)?

Hybrid learning is the best of both worlds and is the best choice for students. It accommodates different learning styles, while allowing for a fully immersive university experience. Hybrid learning protects the health and well-being of students, while respecting the fact that many students prefer in-person learning. 

Why are we not pushing for hybrid learning more? Because it is too much work for professors who make (nearly) 6-figures a year to record their lessons and provide an avenue for online discussion? 

Most of my professors, even at this stage of the pandemic, are inept at operating technology. Professors are obviously extremely educated in their field, but when they don’t even know how to assign breakout rooms two years into online learning, what the hell is wrong with them? UoT is one of the best universities in the world, but its faculty can’t figure out how to turn on a microphone.

Since the University has passed the buck onto the professors, it is now up to the professors to do the responsible thing and implement hybrid accommodations for their students. If professors are unable or unwilling to do this in order to improve the health, safety, and education of their students, then they should know that their neglect negatively affects the wellbeing of their students.","['would', 'lose', 'much', 'money', 'sum', 'uofts', 'rationale', 'wanting', 'person', 'everything', 'u', 'subsidize', 'cost', 'heating', 'building', 'scam', 'first', 'year', 'exorbitant', 'residence', 'fee', 'make', 'profit', 'selling', 'overpriced', 'physical', 'textbook', 'charge', 'building', 'fee', 'athletic', 'centre', 'never', 'use', 'dont', 'get', 'wrong', 'im', 'fine', 'reasonable', 'level', 'fee', 'service', 'amount', 'nickel', 'diming', 'inperson', 'border', 'scam', 'sometimes', 'dont', 'like', 'paying', 'boat', 'load', 'money', 'prof', 'show', 'teach', 'lecture', 'send', 'ta', 'instead', 'fact', 'uoft', 'chief', 'investment', 'officer', 'make', 'million', 'year', 'simply', 'reinvesting', 'billion', 'university', 'sits', 'onabsolutely', 'make', 'hate', 'way', 'treat', 'u', 'cash', 'cow']",,-0.8831,would lose much money sum uofts rationale wanting person everything u subsidize cost heating building scam first year exorbitant residence fee make profit selling overpriced physical textbook charge building fee athletic centre never use dont get wrong im fine reasonable level fee service amount nickel diming inperson border scam sometimes dont like paying boat load money prof show teach lecture send ta instead fact uoft chief investment officer make million year simply reinvesting billion university sits onabsolutely make hate way treat u cash cow

I’ve seen them being looked down on intentionally or unintentionally by others especially in group projects and assignments. It is not fair at all. They are smart people who learned a second language and know a language that native English speakers might not know. They are already at a disadvantage compared to native English speakers because they have to do all their essays and assignments and presentations in their second language, and do not need others to give them a hard time for it. I believe most of this behaviour is done unintentionally, but by being mindful of it, we all can be more understanding and make a friendlier atmosphere for everyone. I’m probably stating the obvious, but I guess my point is to be nice to others. We don’t know their struggles. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk lol.

EDIT: I probably should clarify this right here, because I’m tired of repeating myself in the comments lol. I’m not talking about those who write poorly, or cannot communicate efficiently, or are not even willing to learn English. It’s totally understandable that it is challenging to work with them if they communicate poorly whether verbally or in writing, and it can take a toll on the whole group’s mark if there’s a group project.

24534,this circlejerk post and comment section is making me want to cheat,I could have cheated today. But I chose not to.,2021-04-08 20:47:21,UofT,Other,"Just want to share with you my experience today.

My internet went down this morning, so I had to go to Robarts to take the test. It was really hard to write a test with a surgical mask on the entire time. I couldn’t breathe properly and I had a really bad headache. As expected, I didn’t do well on that test. The Quercus submission page closed just about the time when I was trying to upload it. I had to submit it through an emergency drop box. However, I was too panicked at that time, and I somehow submitted the original question document without realizing it. I emailed the professor asking whether I will be fine submitting through the emergency drop box. She replied that it’s fine but I've submitted the wrong document. She asked me to submit my answer document asap without making any changes.

Honestly, I have thought about just pretending that I didn’t see her email, quickly make some changes and upload. No one will find out. It could give me a much better grade. It could make me stop feeling upset about not doing well in the test. It could.

But I just decided to email the professor back and upload my answer sheet immediately. I don’t trust myself. I know that the longer I spend considering the cheating option, the more tempting it will become. The professor is really nice, she trusted me, and I should never break her trust.

I feel great right now. I don’t even feel that upset about not doing well on the test. I preserved my integrity. I didn’t let the professor down. I didn’t let her kindness become a means to an evil end.

In conclusion. Don’t cheat. A better grade is nothing compare to your integrity. If you have evil thoughts, do the right thing immediately and shift your attention. Don’t let your professor down.

**tldr; I chose not to cheat and I felt great.**

**And low-key want to thank my professor for trusting me.**

Upon departing, the estimated time of arrival was 15 hours and 45 minutes. My moving time ended up being 15 hours and 15 minutes, and the elapsed time was 16 hours and 45 minutes. I forgot to record on Strava upon exiting, so I hit start near MUSC and the parking lot at 11:49AM.

u/Vegetable-Anybody112 had been on my ass to replicate his[ journey from UofT to Mac](https://www.reddit.com/r/McMaster/comments/1gheive/i_walked_80km_and_107000_steps_to_mcmaster_from/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), but in reverse, for ages. After a ton of positive peer pressure and plotting, I figured it was now or never before the official end of my first year. My exam schedule was spaced out nicely with basically one exam a week, so this ended up working out, even last-minute.

I boldly told him that if I were to do it, unlike him, I'd do it without stopping. I grew up with a competitive nature and versatile athletic background until COVID rendered me a couch potato. But I did it. I walked from McMaster to UTSG (New College specifically): 72km and 100k steps in under 17 hours with hardly any real resting breaks, a step length ranging from 46–83 cm, and standing at just 5’1-5’2. Not once did I idle apart from when I had to at crosswalks and the final 1-hour stretch, where my body basically forced me to after I exhausted too much energy due to a bizarre situation.

My physical condition wasn’t at its peak either since I'd already done a string of late-night expeditions with others from April 1–4:[ Dundurn Stairs](https://www.reddit.com/r/McMaster/comments/1jowl0t/latenight_visit_to_dundurn_stairs_with_a_group/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button),[ Sam Lawrence Park](https://www.reddit.com/r/McMaster/comments/1jpp7ie/visit_to_sam_lawrence_park_turned_into_a_detoured/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), Cootes Paradise,[ Barton Street](https://www.reddit.com/r/McMaster/comments/1jrg1av/we_walked_down_the_entirety_of_barton_street/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and[ Devil’s Punchbowl](https://www.reddit.com/r/McMaster/comments/1jseksl/walking_from_devils_punchbowl_to_mac_a_night_full/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). My Converse's padding has wore down so bad that I could constantly feel my feet sinking. I packed a small bag that carried 3 water bottles (2 plastic and 1 reusable), 4 protein bars, 3 Kit Kats, a pouch of chargers, 2 power banks, IDs, toothbrush/paste, t-shirt, and some supplies. I packed accordingly so that I genuinely wouldn't need to spend a penny or stop elsewhere for any particular reason.

I had my first exam that ended at 10PM the day before, so I had dinner pretty late and made sure to get my hours in. Sunday was a warm and sunny day, around 15°C, which are two conditions I don't quite enjoy. Yet there I was, ready to begin, on an empty stomach, wearing all black, a jacket, and cargo pants. I basically walked and texted for the first 4 hours. Then my battery started draining due to full brightness against the sun. Just as I was about to charge 5 hours in, my power bank failed me and I panicked. The power bank u/usedPOS graciously lent me a few days prior for the sake of this journey came in clutch. Thank you to u/Candid_Vast9388 and u/usedPOS for providing some oddly specific pics (may or may not have been feet and ass pics, respectively) as morale.

Early on, I had to pause briefly to figure out how to deal with the highway crossings, but in total, I only took 2–3 legitimate breaks near the very end. I had my first sip of water 5 hours in. My first protein bar at 6 hours and first Kit Kat at 8 hours. My first and last washroom stop was 12 hours in at an A&W in Toronto. And my first official break was less than 1 hour away from the destination. 

I shared my location with my friends, u/Candid_Vast9388 and u/Vegetable-Anybody112, who were impressed and commented that I was initially blazing through it all. I was averaging 10km in \~2 hours. I hit 40km in \~8.5 hours of non-stop walking, holding a steady pace of 4-5.50km/h. But after the 9-hour mark, the crash began to creep in ever so slightly. From there onward, grass and dirt became my best friends whenever I could locate any. Touching grass had never felt more euphoric. I reached the ""Welcome to Toronto"" sign in 11.5 hours. My time in Toronto and the final hour to UTSG, though, were absolute hell, especially since I couldn't locate any patches of grass or dirt and stubbornly limped across the sidewalk. Needless to say, this truly pushed my limits, and I went through a turbulent emotional roller coaster ride.","['kind', 'shoe', 'wear', 'chuck', 'taylor', 'star', 'high', 'top', 'longest', 'walk', 'never', 'really', 'documented', 'walk', 'sleep', 'schedule', 'absolutely', 'cooked', 'last', 'sem', 'wandering', 'aimlessly', 'hour', 'across', 'hamilton', 'mostly', 'trail', 'night', 'clear', 'head', 'term', 'documented', 'walk', 'itd', 'barton', 'street', 'one', 'took', 'hour', 'break', 'devil', 'punchbowl', 'one', 'took', 'hour', 'min', 'nonstop', 'one', 'without', 'destroying', 'foot', 'preparation', 'mid', 'willpower', 'endurance', 'longlasting', 'small', 'ulcer', 'foot', 'theyre', 'stopping', 'going', 'day']",,0.5109,kind shoe wear chuck taylor star high top longest walk never really documented walk sleep schedule absolutely cooked last sem wandering aimlessly hour across hamilton mostly trail night clear head term documented walk itd barton street one took hour break devil punchbowl one took hour min nonstop one without destroying foot preparation mid willpower endurance longlasting small ulcer foot theyre stopping going day

https://twitter.com/amiewol45816678/status/1356973742899961857?s=21

This is clear retaliation against a very basic right for any UBC student: filing a complaint against an instructor or transferring out of a class that does not work for whatever reason. While Wolf is trying to spin this into a victim narrative of being “silenced” as an Indigenous prof (and tricking both The Ubyssey and The Peak into giving her favourable coverage without even talking to the other side), she very clearly admits that she posted the EXACT SAME REVIEW in 12 students’ files as retaliation and is trying to hurt their career prospects now.

I really hope the students sue both Wolf and UBC, who allowed people like this into the institution and created this situation by transferring the students from the class.

Can you imagine paying UBC to help you become a teacher and then having the same institution diminish/destroy those chances because some prof judged you to be “bad” and “colonialist”? What kind of bullshit is this?

UPDATE: Wolf is back on Twitter, writing things like “ Anonymity is the home base of white supremacist actions. My former students are slandering me behind my back and to the media. This is what Indigenous specific misogyny looks like. They must be named and held accountable for their violence. Above all, they should not be teachers.” At this point, allowing this continue and the failure to stop the mobbing of students is entirely on UBC.","['surprised', 'cbc', 'globalnews', 'didnt', 'get', 'yet']",,0.2263,surprised cbc globalnews didnt get yet

Some of you may have come across my post a few months back ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/h0hvrn/honest_review_of_uoft_pharmd_program/)) about the pharmacy program at UofT/industry trends in Canada. Despite my less than cheery outlook then, the situation has rapidly deteriorated even more, and I wanted to give you a front-seat view on what is happening with our profession. I have attached screenshots from the pharmacy group at UofT (c/o 2020), names blurred to respect my colleagues' privacy.

Nobody is willing to speak up, for fear of ""burning bridges in the field"" (which is utter nonsense by the way, because the regulatory bodies/faculty clearly doesn't give a sh\*t about us). I recognize there isn't much that can be done, but at the very least, I can show you the real side of pharmacy in Canada right now.

**Our own regulatory body thinks we aren't needed enough to be licensed, so recent grads are working for minimum wage in high-risk environments.**

For those of you who are unfamiliar, in order to practice as a pharmacist, not only do you need to graduate from the pharmacy program, you also need to write a board exam (PEBC). This is consistent with many other healthcare professions (e.g. medicine).

Our class was supposed to be licensed in June; it's almost November now, and not a single person is licensed to work as a pharmacist because our board exams are postponed indefinitely. In fact, **most of our class will be unable to practice until June of 2021 at the earliest, one full year after graduating,** coinciding with the class of 2021. As unlicensed pharmacy grads, we are being asked to work for minimum wage while taking on the full scope of activities as a pharmacist. Other professions, like medicine, have granted conditional licensure in light of COVID. How come pharmacy didn't waive offer the same thing? Despite the line-ups you may see in pharmacies right now for flu-shots and other services, our regulatory body told us we *""aren't needed enough""* to receive conditional licensure to practice.

How did they decide that? Well, they sent out surveys to practicing pharmacists, specifically those in the community setting (e.g. Shoppers/Rexall), to gage need. There was a clear conflict of interest because pharmacy owners want to hire labour as cheaply as possible, and they know that if we aren't licensed, we can perform all the duties of a licensed pharmacist for minimum wage. And this is exactly what happened. After OCP deemed that there was no need for immediate licensure, every Shoppers/Rexall started looking *specifically* for unlicensed grads, offering $15/hr at best, often < 10hrs/ week. To add salt to the wound, we had to pay OCP a fee to work as unlicensed grads. To put this into perspective, our licensing exam > $4000; you would have to work over 260 hrs just to breakeven. And quite frankly, OCP has little interest in entertaining when they are willing to grant us licensure; they stated that **adequate intern renumeration and professional areas are not areas of interest to OCP** (please see pics). Is this for the better of the profession and the public, or greed and indifference? I will let you draw your own conclusions.

**Faculty sold us out to retail chains, knowingly compromising our health, while they worked safely from home.**

When COVID started peaking in March, many UofT pharmacy students were finishing their *unpaid* placements in retail chains. While medicine cancelled these placements for student safety, our faculty sent the chains an email - without consulting us, and without our knowledge - indicating that pharmacy students would be more than willing to uphold the needs of the community and stay true to the profession by continuing to practice (ironically - due to *increased need* for pharmacy services, as a public duty). This is after the hospitals cancelled their rotations and sent students home. Faculty showed absolutely no regard to our safety; they made this decision from their ivory tower, safely working at home, purposely keeping the correspondence hidden from students directly in harm's way; there was inadequate PPE, many lived with immunocompromised family members - and keep in mind, these rotations were unpaid, and we had to pay tuition to the school while working in this environment. Only after the lockdowns came in full force did they retract their original statement.

**What are pharmacy grads doing right now?**

Many are working for minimum wage in retail for financial reasons. There have been discussions on a loan repayment program. Some went back to undergrad, some just quit the field. I know for you sure if you ask my colleagues right now if they regret pharmacy school, > 90% would tell you they wish they did something else. Don't believe me? I will let the pictures do the talking.

Feel free to share for awareness.

**EDIT: How can you help?**

Thank you *so much* for the support and kind words. If you can share this post to other venues (any that you might think is relevant/be interested to hear about this), it would really help. This post got deleted in the PrePharmacy and similar forums. The more people who are aware, the more likely a bigger outlet will pick it up.

I agree taking this public is probably the best course of action, but our student leaders have been unwilling to do so in fear of retaliation by the school. We would be really grateful for your help.

**EDIT 2:** Just received a response to this post from the group in question. Despite my best attempt to advocate for our profession here, my post was criticized by our purported student leaders due to its anonymous nature; ironic they say this because they never entertained the venues where real advocacy could be achieved (e.g. the media) - this is the fear of retaliation I have been trying to stress, and also the downfall of our profession. Everyone superficially agrees now on the group, and the voices of reason are drowned out again. They are all too afraid to speak up. I expected better, but I was sorely disappointed. Don't be like us.

6211,where did they say that others arent protesting the right thing all i see is a statement that op personally prioritizes other issues they didnt say its wrong for others to have different priorities,"As promised, I strolled through Kings College and this is what it looked like",2024-05-23 17:39:51,UofT,Discussion,"Just want to start by saying that I don’t remotely belong to either cultural group. I was born in Toronto and have had the privilege of a life without civil war. My only stake in this situation is that I was a student during the fall/winter semester when the conflict started hitting headlines and I’ll be graduating in June. I’ll be observing the people who will be protesting on convocation day alongside my peers, who have all been pretty quiet about this topic. This post is for the people who are curious to know what their graduation ceremony is going to look like if its at the convocation hall next week.

The impression I got from this encampment was this: it was quiet, there wasnt anybody blocking doors to the adjacent buildings, and there wasnt really an air of chaos that has been exaggerated on insta. Its peaceful. It was just asian tourists visiting the campus for their kids and people going to and from class. There is an entrance to the encampment thats being guarded by a handful of people, but not much human activity. Of the 6 whole protestors I saw, it wasnt exactly a mixed group, but my sample size is too low to really confirm anything. No they were not wearing masks or trying to conceal their identity. Unfortunately it smells like weed and other things you could guess would come from an encampment, but thats to be expected. In contrast, there was a lot of construction going on and contractors working all around the encampment. I feel a little bad. That whole stretch of park has no shade so I wager its hot as hell in there.

So no, Kings College isnt a warzone, and you can go about convocation without feeling unsafe. There are a number of places where you can take decent pictures without getting tents in the background. Nobody is blocking doors and going after eachother.

One person on this reddit said that uoft put the fence up to deliberately stop the anticipation of a protest, but after visiting today I think that’s just bs. 🤦‍♀️ I counted at least 3 other sites that were fenced off for construction and landscaping all around the circle. Plus, the work that is being prepared for the circle was no different from the construction on Robarts and Woodsworth. Its ironic that this same fence is now being used as a barrier preventing contractors, or really anybody, from entering the park. I did not try to enter this checkpoint thing, and I’m aware that other journalists have attempted to do this with varying results.

I finally formed an opinion on this. I think it’s great that people are practicing their freedom of expression. You should be allowed to advocate for vulnerable groups without getting shot by cops. While I think the war/crimes against humanity is awful, I actually don’t really support the encampment and their demands. Literally every facet of our country has had a direct and indirect involvement in supporting warfare beyond our borders. So even if they were to succeed in getting UofT to stop being involved with companies like Hebrew University of Jerusalem(??), or the Daughters for Life Foundation (?????) I honestly dont believe the unrelenting warfare in the middle east-east asia will ever really end. Children will still die at the same rate, relief workers will still die, genocides are still going to be funded by Canadian corpos, families will still face tragedy, and the isms will continue onward because nobody can agree on how the borders should be redrawn. 

A brief crash course on the history of Israel in my undergrad still feels true to me. I know that is my oblivious privilege talking, but this is all I see before me. There are so many problems in the world and I only have the energy for the ones happening here on this side of the globe. The fentanyl epidemic, the children who make up the majority of clients in Canadian foodbanks, the unaffordability of life as we know it, and the isolated elderly populace here in the GTA have my full attention. 

I’m at peace with the protest and I wish the protesters well. If they get UofT to yield to their demands, that is awesome and I’ll applaud their efforts. I hope other people find their peace with this too.

The reasoning is simple. Without a megathread, /r/UBC would be flooded with nothing but questions that apply to only a small percentage of the UBC population.

---

**Examples of questions that belong here**

- comparing courses or instructors
- asking about how hard an exam is
- syllabus requests
- inquiries about majors, programs, and job prospects
- ""what-to-do if I failed/was late/missed the cutoff""

**What you don't need to post here**

- **Post-exam threads** (ex. 'How did you find the Birb 102 midterm)
- rants, raves, shout-outs or criticisms of programs. 
- Other content that is not a question/inquiry

---

**Process**

- It might take up to 4 hours for your post to be approved (except when we're sleeping). 
- Suggested sort is set to new, so new comments will always be the most visible. 
- You are allowed to repost the same question on the megathread at a reasonable frequency (wait at least a day after each post). This is true even if you've already gotten a response.**

This letter was sent to students of Dr. Amie Wolf today:

""The University of British Columbia Destroys an Indigenous Professor’s Reports of White Supremacy among Teacher Candidates

On Wednesday, January 13, 2021, Dr. Amie Wolf was instructed by the Dean of the UBC Department of Educational Studies, Dr. Marianne McTavish, to d**elete the Interim Reports she had written for twelve teacher candidates**. In Winter Term 1, 2020, the students were taking a required, credit course that Dr. Wolf has taught since July 2020: Indigenous Education in Canada. **Wolf observed that the participants were not ready to teach Indigenous subject matter, citing their unwillingness to critically examine their own biases, attitudes, beliefs, and values to facilitate change, as stipulated in the BC Teacher’s Council, Professional Standards for BC Educators**. **Dr. Wolf passed the students despite that fact, on a condition that was laid out in their Interim Reports: that they continue to try to learn how to respectfully teach Indigenous perspectives, histories, and world views in an elementary classroom context.**

During the meeting with Dr. McTavish, Dr. Amie Wolf was told that **the President’s Office destroyed these reports, which were edited, signed, and emailed to the students by the Director of the Teacher Education Office,** Mr. John Yamamoto, and the Indigenous Education in Canada course supervisor, Dr. Shannon Leddy. The decision to censor Dr. Wolf’s Interim Reports **was the Dean’s response to an anonymous letter from a parent of one of the adult teacher candidates, expressing concern that the Interim Reports could negatively impact their adult-child’s future employment opportunities**. On January 15, 2021, Dr. Wolf communicated to all parties that she would not delete the assessments.

“I was told by Dr. McTavish to never speak about my meeting with her or about the content of the Interim Reports,” Dr. Wolf explains. “However, I think what the top levels of UBC administration have done must not be swept under the rug. They have committed an act of erasure and tampered with documents. The public needs to know about this. The Indians are in the fort now, and we’re not going away. The University has to start doing what it says it is committed to doing.”

On its website, the UBC Teacher Education Office claims that its faculty are “committed to preparing educators who will be knowledgeable, capable, flexible, and compassionate members of the profession guided by a sense of social and ethical responsibility in relation to the students and wider society.” Resonating with those words in the 2020 UBC Indigenous Strategic Plan, UBC President, Dr. Santa Ono writes that UBC “can produce systemic change... by developing and implementing innovative and path-breaking research, teaching, and engagement with Indigenous communities.”

When Dr. Wolf reads words like these, she knows what they actually mean. “Indigenous people are experts at seeing lip-service. We know when promises like this are put down on paper, they don’t mean anything in terms of how our lives change for the better. It’s the same battle, different piece of paper. We are the ones who are stuck with doing all the work, and we meet the same barriers every time. People say they are committed to equity, diversity, and inclusion, but they want to keep their privilege at the same time. It doesn’t work.”

Dr. Wolf notes that she is was the only person at meetings about censuring her work without pay. “I am remunerated for teaching,” she points out, “but I am not paid to attend meetings that quash me, and I am not paid to fight colonial genocide, which this is. The institutions of Canada use their policies and positional authority to pave over me and push me to the edge of disappearing. I’m exhausted, I feel alone, and making ends meet is always hard.”

Dr. Wolf fears for her employment. She is a sessional instructor and an Adjunct Professor. The course she teaches is awarded to her on a per semester basis only. “I know that speaking out will probably cost me again,” she says, pointing out that, in 2016, the UBC Sauder School of Business stopped contracting her educational services after she stated in the media that a course requirement on First Nations’ rights and title is needed, campus-wide. “The University wants to sound progressive and to look they are doing something different. However, the shift of resources – the money that it takes to actually restructure – is still not happening.” The result: Indigenous professors who are willing to assimilate are the only one left in all levels of the B.C. education systems.

Released in 2020, the report, In Plain Site identifies what Dr. Wolf feels are the needed systems changes to all B.C. institutions. “In every colonial system in Canada, there are no established policies or procedures to protect Indigenous people from white supremacy. When we are eliminated for trying to create change, the institution can just spit is out; there are no avenues within the institutions for recourse or for accountability. The anti-Indigenous bias is hard wired into the structure.”

Dr. Wolf is hoping that, by going to the media with this story, systemic change will be spurred to actualize at UBC. “My goal right now is just to not disappear,” she says. “My message matters, and my student assessments are correct. I’m an Indigenous scholar and leader, and I deserve to be paid fairly for what I do and to be protected and helped as I make the changes the President of UBC says it supports. Policies, procedures, and monetary provisions to implement these must be adopted at the highest levels of all Canadian institutions.” ""

Since this is no longer pinned, it will be more of an information thread as originally intended, so I won't be updating the TLDR bits as much . Use this as a means of educating yourself on COVID-19 as well as discovering useful resources in tracking/learning about the virus.

There are two arguments regarding the novel coronavirus. One is the panic reaction, and the other is the opposite, saying people are overreacting. Both are too far in one direction.

**I want to re-iterate that this virus knows no borders and is not an excuse to be racist towards Chinese people who literally have no control over any of this. They probably have suffered most in the last few months.** If anything, take your frustrations out towards the Chinese government for mishandling the situation early on.

**TLDR International Situation**

* There is no point in summarizing this since this is a rapidly evolving situation. Please refer to the resources on the bottom of this post or this [tracker](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6). I also highly recommend viewing WHO's [daily situation reports.](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/)
* Generally, many countries are now outside containment are in mitigation.
* As for China, their cases have tapered off and the focus has shifted internationally.
* This is now the first coronavirus to be declared a pandemic

**TLDR Canada Situation  \[As of 13/03/2020\]**

* The Government of Canada is warning against all non essential travel outside the country.
* International flights will only be accepted at certain airports (TBA).
* Cruise ships with over 500 people have been banned from docking in Canada until July.
* The risk is still considered low for Canadians (for people who have an issue with this assessment, low risk does not mean ignore that this is happening, please exercise caution).
* For active cases, refer to [PHAC](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection.html)
* Sophie Trudeau has been diagnosed with COVID-19. Justin Trudeau will remain in isolation for 14 days.

**TLDR Current Situation in Quebec \[As of 14/03/2020\]**

* Overall risk remains low.
* All indoor events with more than 250 people have been [banned](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/covid-quebec-march12-1.5494882). Schools can remain open but should not have more than 250 people in the room.
* People returning from abroad should self-isolate for 14 days regardless of where they came from. Anyone with flu symptoms should also self-isolate for 14 days regardless of travel history.
* St. Patrick's Day parade is postponed.
* 24 positive cases. 3 are hospitalized.
* A recent case took public transportation, see [here (french)](https://www.quebec.ca/sante/problemes-de-sante/a-z/coronavirus-2019/#c45931) or [here (english)](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/#c45931) for what forms and dates.
* 4 hospitals designed to treat COVID-19. 2 clinics set-up exclusively for testing, more on the way (see relevant sections below). Tests are no longer being sent to the National Microbiology Lab for confirmation.
* If you are experiencing symptoms, **STAY HOME**, call 1-877-644-4545. See relevant sections below for more information.

* **Classes and exams have been suspended Friday, March 13, 2020. All campus events that attract more than 250 people will also be cancelled this weekend.** Before you take out your pitchforks, you should assume that this time will be used by McGill to evaluate their options and we will have a more long-term solution by the end of the weekend. **With Quebec suspending in-person instruction for the next 2 weeks, we should expect to receive an official statement from McGill soon.**
* If you are concerned or would like to voice displeasure with the McGill administration, please contact the office of the dean of students. **I'd also like to add that NOT sending more than one email and remaining polite with university administrators is critical. The people you are emailing are humans too. Please treat them with respect.**
   * Email: [deanofstudents@mcgill.ca](mailto:deanofstudents@mcgill.ca)
* From McGill if you email the DoS: Please note that any emails regarding COVID-19 will be forwarded to [covid-19.info@mcgill.ca](mailto:covid-19.info@mcgill.ca) , and you can expect to hear a response back from them within 24 – 48 hours.

**Naming Convention**

Coronaviruses are a family of respiratory viruses which includes the common cold, SARS, MERS and the new novel coronavirus.

The novel coronavirus has officially been named SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it causes is called COVID-19. I kind of use everything interchangeably here but you get the gist of it.

I don't think this is necessary to mention in a sub for a university, but, the name coronavirus is derived from the crown like spikes (corona is latin for crown) on the surface of the virus. This has nothing to do with the beer. Drink to your heart's content.

**“COVID-19 was caused by someone eating bats”**

The actual source of it is unknown. It is likely to have originated from bats, and transmitted to an intermediate host similar to SARS. It was likely transmitted from an animal in a wet market, not from someone eating bats.

\[regardless, these wild life markets need to die. this is not the first epidemic/pandemic that has begun from one and it will not be the last. This has all been very predictable for epidemiologists\]

**""This is a conspiracy and the government are trying to kill us”**

Stop.

**""This started in a Chinese lab”**

Stop.

**""This started in an American lab”**

Stop.

**“The flu kills far more people every year and nobody panics”**

We do not know the exact death rate of novel coronavirus because mild cases can go undiagnosed. But we have to work with the numbers we have and the death rate worldwide according to WHO is around 3.4%. The true rate could be lower and the mortality rate is lower.

Moreover, if you look at South Korea who have wide spread testing and a younger population than the likes of Italy, they have a death rate of 0.7% which is still higher than the seasonal flu.

Looking at the numbers so far, this is far more deadly than the seasonal flu. Additionally, it is estimated that a single person can spread it to 2-2.5 people (source: WHO) which is higher than influenza.

For reference, seasonal influenza has killed 46,000 people in the US this year so far.

Reminder 2: H1N1 is even milder and still killed up to 151,700-575,000 people. We should not allow that to happen. As an FYI, H1N1 has a 0.02 % mortality rate. With the same argument, are you okay with 575,000 people dying?

**“Only old people die from COVID-19”**

It is true that the most at risk group are the elderly or people with underlying health conditions or compromised immune systems.

The fatality rate increases substantially for those over 50 and continues increasing with age. For those below 40, the death rate is low.

Children are also less susceptible to the disease. When they do develop it, symptoms are mild. The reason for this is unknown and this is not conclusive.

This does not mean that you cannot die from COVID-19. In Wuhan, it was observed by the WHO team that young people who did suffer from severe symptoms often deteriorated and died quickly. These were young, fit, and healthy people with no underlying health conditions. Wuhan is of course a special case, but do not assume that every death has been an elderly or sick person.

Am I trying to make you panic? No. At the end of the day, most cases are mild. And even from the severe cases, very few are critical. But, you should not dismiss this as something that won’t affect you.

**“Governments are overreacting, it’s just mild symptoms for most people”**

If this is allowed to spread without containment, health systems will be overwhelmed to the point that quality of healthcare will suffer and many more people will die.

Hospitals are already overwhelmed here in Canada. We’re also still in influenza season. If the government can stay in containment phase, they can reduce the burden on the healthcare system.

Just look at this figure of overcrowding in Quebec ER's, how do you think they would cope with a pandemic?

[An illustration of ER visits without being seen by a doctor: iedm.org](https://preview.redd.it/guebi4am49m41.jpg?width=641&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d4596a6628a603feded7338ea389d64c11282c4)

Please also have consideration for people suffering from other conditions such as cancer. In Wuhan, [access to healthcare for people suffering from cancer dropped](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/world/asia/china-coronavirus-cancer.html) as hospitals filled with coronavirus cases.  Also be considerate of countries with poor medical infrastructure, they would not be able to cope with an influx of cases.

It also reduces the number of people actively being treated. Think of it as a bell curve. If mitigated/contained effectively, think of a wide but short bell curve whereas with none, think of a very high narrow bell curve in which the health system would be overwhelmed.

[Bell curve illustration, only displays on new reddit. Source: flattenthecruve.com](https://preview.redd.it/j4coociy29m41.png?width=2148&format=png&auto=webp&s=11b300ff114249ada2580ffe1021a13e1f576e16)

In short, the notion of, ""let everyone get sick, it'll be fine, most people will recover"" is a mindset that would result in disaster and unnecessary lives lost.

**""It's fine, warm weather will kill the virus""**

There is no evidence that this is seasonal. This is a new virus so we don't know much.

Look at MERS for reference as well, literally birthed in the sweltering heat of the Middle East. We can't just blindly say this will go away in the summer. This will be relevant for the coming months.

**“I should start stockpiling supplies and face masks”**

First off, face masks will likely not help you in terms of catching the disease. A regular surgical will not protect you from coronaviruses. They do not prevent a virus being transmitted to you. It does not have a tight enough fit.

An N95 mask can protect you from coronavirus, however, most people do not wear them properly, and medical professionals have them specially fitted. They’re also uncomfortable and are far from necessary for the average population.

I've seen a lot of people wearing loose fitting N95's or wearing one over large beards. Or even only covering their mouth and not their nose.

For an average person, a face mask could even do more harm than good. People tend to constantly touch and adjust them (thus touching their face) which is what is likely to infect you. I constantly see people touching their masks and adjusting them.

Masks should be worn by people who are sick to reduce spread of the disease or people taking care of the sick.

Please don't use this as an excuse to mock people who wear masks. I  am personally against mask use because I want to stop the panic reaction to hoard and stockpile face masks, and I am following what is recommended by medical professionals. But don't use someone wearing a mask as an excuse to be racist or discriminatory towards people. The use of face masks is very much also a matter of cultural differences amongst our friends from Asia. I'm sure those of us not from North America can relate to having different values.

There is also no point in hoarding months of supplies. I assume you already have enough toilet paper to last 2 weeks, so why people are hoarding a year or several months supply is mind boggling. You should have around 2 weeks of food/supplies at home in case of quarantine but that is sufficient. We do NOT have a shortage of essential supplies here in Canada. Everything is being restocked. 

**“If face masks don’t help you, why do doctor’s wear it!”**

Doctor’s are exposed to far more sick people than you and for a much longer amount of time. They are most at risk in terms of contracting the disease and need to take as many precautions as possible.

Please stop stockpiling masks and save them for sick people or medical professionals.

**If you insist on wearing masks**

Cotton masks or active carbon masks will do absolutely nothing to protect you from droplets. Stick to surgical (although almost realistically nothing as well)/N95.

Dispose of surgical masks every day. Refrain from adjusting them constantly. Sanitize your hand after disposing them.

N95 masks can be reused until damaged/wet.

See how to wear a surgical mask [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrvFrH_npQI)

To re-iterate: Masks are most helpful for healthcare workers or those in close contact with people who are ill; washing your hands is far more effective in controlling the spread of the illness.

**Can my dog get COVID-19?**

Yes and No. There is a dog that tested weakly positive for the disease, but they showed no symptoms of illness.

The reporting of a dog being infected was extremely irresponsible and just done to stoke fear. There is no evidence that your pet will become sick and not much is known (as in there is no reported instance and this is not expected) on whether they can be carriers.  This was likely a case of human to animal transmission but your pet transmitting the disease to others is unlikely through animal to human transmission.

**What do I need to do?**

Practice good hygiene. Wash your hands for 20 seconds with soap. If you do not have access to soap and water, use an alcohol based sanitizer.

If you are sick: please cough into your elbow, not in your hands or the air. If you cough into a tissue, dispose of the tissue immediately and clean your hands. It is jarring how little basic hygiene is practiced.

Be careful on the STM. If you touch the handles, don't touch your phone all day. Sanitize before. Just as an FYI, the STM said they would start cleaning their trains more often which is still not often. From once every 5-6 weeks, it is now every week.

Again, I need to emphasize your phones. They are something we touch without thinking just like our faces. If you leave the metro, (but were using your phone after touching rails inside), disinfect your hand, and touch your phone, you are effectively cancelling out what you just did.

This is not a cure all. You could practice the best hygiene in the world and still be infected through close contact with someone who is infected, but these are good habits to have.

Update: At the moment, you should be practicing social distancing and minimizing contact with others. Stay home. Do go on walks if you need to.  

**What are symptoms**

Symptoms are comparable to the flu.

The most common symptoms by far are dry cough and fever.

There is misinformation floating around that if you have runny nose, you do not have the novel coronavirus. While less likely, runny nose is a possible symptom, as well as fatigue, shortness of breath, headaches, chills, nausea, etc…

You may develop pneumonia. In more serious cases, the pneumonia be severe and people can suffer from organ failure.

Most cases (81%) are mild. 14% are severe. 5% are critical. Of the critical patients, 50% died.

**Is there a cure?**

There is no known cure or specific treatment. You will be treated for your symptoms.

Most people will require no treatment and will recover on their own.

A vaccine should not be expected for at least a year, but it is possible that specific treatment can arrive sooner. Multiple human trials are currently ongoing or planned.

**“People can spread the virus without any symptoms”**

Based on information so far, asymptomatic transmission is rare and represents only a small fraction of cases. For people who are asymptomatic, they do eventually develop symptoms. The possibility of asymptomatic transmission is something where proper hygiene will play a heavy factor.

Update: I just want to add that I am not saying asymptomatic transmission is not possible. It just does not appear to be the main mode of transmission. Data on this can of course change.

There have also been cases where the incubation period has been over 14 days, however, these are far and few and are an edge case. In most cases, the average incubation period is around 5-6 days.

**Can you get sick from it more than once?**

It seems possible, although unlikely, but this is currently an unknown.

Some people who have contracted it twice appeared to have no disease. It's really just an unknown at this point.

**I’ve been travelling and have symptoms**

Please don’t go to class. Do NOT present yourself to an emergency room unannounced. Call 1-877-644-4545 and move from there.

If you are asked to present yourself, do not take public transportation or a taxi. Take private transportation or transportation will likely be arranged for you.

Inform McGill of your situation. They are monitoring the situation and will be understanding if you need to quarantine yourself. The official advice of McGill is to self isolate if you have travelled from anywhere and are experiencing symptoms. If you suffer a similar situation as u/[pmmeyourpuzzlespls](https://www.reddit.com/user/pmmeyourpuzzlespls/), and health authorities turns you away, try to stay home. Continue pushing if you have been an area with a large outbreak.

**I've been travelling in a high risk area but have no symptoms**

If you do not have symptoms but have been to Iran, Northern Italy, or Hubei Province region, you should still self-isolate and monitor for symptoms. This is what McGill formally recommends so they should be able to accommodate you in terms of school regardless of what a prof tells you.

I personally also think you should self isolate if you've been to (all) of Italy, South Korea, Germany, and any other high risk regions, but I cannot comment on how McGill would accommodate you in that case.

UPDATE: As of March 12, 2020, the Government of Quebec are encouraging you to isolate regardless of whether you are symptomatic.

**I have not been travelling and have symptoms**

Stay home.

At this point and time, it is likely that it just a cold or flu. In general, you should stay home no matter what, but I know none of us are going to do that.

If someone you know has recently been to Italy, Iran, South Korea or China, and are also ill, and have been in contact with them, see above.

UPDATE: As of March 12, 2020, the Government of Quebec are encouraging anyone with flu symptoms to stay home regardless of travel history.

**Should I cancel travel plans?**

As of 13/03/2020, travel is being restricted to Canadians. 

Please follow [Canada's travel advisories.](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/advisories)

Moreover, following the directive issued yesterday by the Quebec government and the director of public health, all student travel outside Canada for internships, student exchanges, international mobility programs, competitions or conferences is suspended until further notice.

If you decide to ignore travel advisories, understand that if shit hits the fan, you shouldn't expect Canada to repatriate you (although I wouldn't expect shit to hit the fan again like in the Hubei province). 

Moreover, at this point and time, understand that should you leave the country, you may have issues re-entering. If you do re-enter Canada, you will be required to quarantine for 14 days.


**How is international response?**

China's initial response was deplorable (although still far better than SARS) and they should not be let off the hook, as this could have been avoided.

However, after the fact, their response has been excellent although in an ethical grey area. Big props to China at this point for being proactive. Although their cases are tapering off, they are still ordering more medical equipment and preparing beds in some cities as if an outbreak is still coming.

Basically, had China reacted earlier, the outbreak would have been far less significant. But the converse is also true, if they reacted later, there would have been a significant difference.

Meanwhile internationally, the world had a long time to prepare and many did not take advantage. This is particularly true in Europe where they only started to think about getting more equipment after the fact.

South Korea's response has been excellent. A big differentiator for them is widespread testing which has without doubt helped reduce the spread and death rate.

Iran is likely to have substantially more cases than they are reporting (although this is just an opinion).

**How is Canada’s response?**

Canada’s response has been excellent in terms of tracking cases/containment. We are still in containment. Although that can change depending on the situation in the US.

If the situation in the US continues to worsen, we can expect cases to be exported very soon.

Evidently, this is also a lesson that travel bans do not work or at the very least are not a cure all. Canada has been far from strict in terms of travel restriction as opposed to other countries.

Airplanes are filthy. See how filthy [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKJEDHKPyhg).

**How is McGill's response?**

It is good that they are placing sanitizer throughout the school and are creating awareness for the virus. I would not expect any more measures from McGill unless a case is found on campus or a serious outbreak occurs in Quebec, in which case you can probably expect strict action to be taken.

In other words, not very proactive. It's going to be reactive.

**What is Quebec doing?**

Quebec has designated 4 hospitals to treat the novel coronavirus:

\- The Jewish General \[Montreal\]. The Jewish has an entire pavilion specifically created to deal with infectious diseases which opened in 2016.

\- Sainte Justine \[Montreal\]

\- Quebec Heart and Lung Institute \[Quebec City\]

\- Centre Hospitalier de l’Université Laval \[Quebec City\]

Furthermore, they have also set-up testing clinics specifically for the novel coronavirus. They are located in:

\- Hôtel-Dieu Hospital \[Montreal\]

\- Azur Clinic \[Longueuil\]

There are more clinics planned for or already open, authorities will direct you if necessary.

At least one other clinic is expected to open next week in Quebec City. They are appointment only so you need to call 1-877-644-4545 to be admitted.

On March 12, 2020, they also announced new guidelines on what you should if you are ill. These are sprinkled throughout this post, but if you're too lazy to check, click [here](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/covid-quebec-march12-1.5494882), or check the TLDR on top.

**Takeaway**

* Be calm, be vigilant and listen to authorities
* Practice good hygiene (not because of this only, but in general)
* Stop acting like this is not going to affect you. This is a concerning situation and one you should take seriously. Don't shrug this off as just as bad as the flu. See what Dr. Fauci says [here](https://www.cnn.com/videos/health/2020/03/10/anthony-fauci-americans-sot-wh-coronavirus-briefing-vpx.cnn)
* Follow reputable news sources. A lot are stoking fear and creating clickbait. One example was a recent study that the virus mutated early on. The media decided to twist this, and the word mutation is obviously a scary one to use, particularly for those with no education in sciences. This is normal and expected behaviour.

Or the posts about SJC members disgusting and unsettling behaviour during the AMS election.

SJC stop using Palestinian’s trauma as a way to fame as an activist, your actions have direct repercussions on the Palestinian community at UBC. I don’t think you have all realized how ridiculous it is that a bunch of white saviours are acting like they are the victims during an ongoing genocide. Your club lacks accountability, and rather than critically think and use opportunities to advocate for others on campus, you managed to bring up hatred within the Palestinian and wider UBC community.

77051,could also be people who just want to keep their identity safe from protesters not disregarding your point but as you mentioned half of them are not new accounts this already tells some real people are actually mad,Sub is being brigaded by brand new accounts and people confirmed not to be tied to UBC complaining about the protests -be aware,2025-03-25 04:33:38,UBC,News,"There’s been a surge of posts from accounts complaining about the protests, and when you click on half of them they are either week-old, or day-old accounts. Another decent proportion are accounts who from their post history are confirmed to have no link to UBC, either living in other cities, or attending other schools. And then a few seem to be genuine UBC folks.

Posting this because it is a pretty common tactic of astroturfing, to brigade subs to create an appearance of consensus where it doesn’t exist, and it is a tactic that is pretty demonstrably done by the very group that the protests are against—from at least 2013 Israel was spending hundreds of millions on spreading anti-Palestinian content on social media (https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-23695896.amp), and they specifically were found by New York Times to have paid for more than 2000 fake accounts spamming comments criticizing pro-Palestinian protesters on facebook alone (https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/05/israel-targeted-lawmakers-in-disinformation-campaign-00161906)

The purpose of these fake accounts is to create the illusion of consensus, and drown out other perspectives. Not saying every post critical of the protesters is not genuine, but if they have a brand new account or one that is clearly not local or with zero connection to UBC that is a pretty big tip-off. 

And lest we forget, our own campus Hillel (pro-Israel advocacy group) was caught putting up pro-Hamas posters (https://ca.news.yahoo.com/ubc-student-group-sjc-stickers-142241426.html) while trying to frame student protesters, leading to student protesters getting death threats and doxxed, so this campus has clearly been a target of ish like this 

(Edit to add: a few commenters have claimed that Hillel had “nothing to do with the pro-Hamas posters and it was just an independent contractor” . Apparently this “independent contractor who worked part time” that Hillel initially refused to name, was identified in the lawsuit as Adam Dobrer, literally the former president of UBC Israel on Campus and a senior Hillel staff member who represented Hillel at AMS meetings as Hillel’s *lead advocacy staff member* (https://ubyssey.ca/news/social-justice-centre-removed-as-plaintiff-in-defamation-lawsuit/) (https://www.ams.ubc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/317-23-Executive-Committee-Minutes-feb1-2023.pdf) )

(will update this as better summaries come out)

* Quebec plans on reaching 75% of vaccinated adults by June 15, 9 days earlier than their goal of June 24.

* Most regions will pass to Orange by May 28, then Yellow by June 14. This means restaurants reopening and indoor very small gatherings being allowed. [You can read the detailed set of measures for yellow and green here.](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/progressive-regional-alert-and-intervention-system)

* On June 28, most regions will become Green, which allows indoor gatherings up to 10 people.

* Schools are reopening this Monday, with some exceptions for sec 3-4-5 in red zones.

* Quebec plans on lifting mandatory masks mid-august if 75% of adults have their second dose by then.

* May 28: **Curfew lifted**, all terraces open, gathering up to 8 people in yards, movement between regions, up to 250 people by section in stadiums and rooms, max 2500.

* Cegeps and universities will be in-person in the Fall.

####Much of the information below has been adapted from /u/brianthelionn's [previous megathread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/fg29hd/addressing_covid19_and_misinformation) Many thanks for all of their hard work maintaining it!

#Symptoms and treatment of COVID-19

COVID-19 is the respiratory infection caused by the novel (new) coronavirus which originated in December in Wuhan, China. It is part of a [family of viruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus) that includes SARS and MERS.

###The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and fatigue. If you feel sick, call 514-644-4545 for advice. If you have difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.

Other possible symptoms include muscle aches, nasal congestion, a runny nose, a sore throat, or diarrhea. However, some cases are totally asymptomatic, while remaining contagious. Symptoms can develop up to 14 days from the date of infection, with an average incubation period of 5 to 6 days.

[Information about the testing site at Hôtel-Dieu Hospital is available here.](https://santemontreal.qc.ca/en/public/coronavirus-covid-19/#c37517)

Around 80% of cases are considered mild, and can generally be treated at home by resting, staying hydrated, and taking medication to reduce fever as needed. However, more severe cases may require hospitalization. If you have difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.

#Steps to take

The virus spreads through tiny droplets that travel through the air when we cough and sneeze. When these land on our hands or other shared surfaces like doorknobs and tables, others can pick up the virus. Accordingly, you should:

* **[Wash your hands regularly with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds.](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/phac-aspc/documents/services/diseases-maladies/reduce-spread-covid-19-wash-your-hands/eng-handwashing.pdf)** Hand sanitizer should only be used in the absence of soap.

* **Cover your coughs and sneezes with your elbow,** and when you use a tissue, immediately dispose of it and wash your hands.

* **Don't touch your face with unwashed hands!** This is the number one way to become infected. Disinfect your phone screen, laptop keyboard, and any other surfaces you frequently use.

* **Practice social distancing by remaining at home.** When you do make essential trips outside, stay at least 2 metres (6 feet) away from others.

* **Leave masks for those who need them:** sick or immunocompromised people, and those who spend time around them, such as health workers. A mask provides little protection if you're just walking around outside, and [chances are you wouldn't be wearing it correctly.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/fhp232/megathread_novel_coronavirus_covid19_pandemic_all/fknrtnc)

* **Make contingency plans** with your family, roommates, friends, and/or neighbours, such as to go shopping for one another if someone is required to quarantine.

#How serious is this?

This is a serious situation and **significantly worse than the seasonal flu.** The virus's overall mortality rate is unknown because many cases are not tested and confirmed, but it the WHO estimates it to be about 2.5–3.5%. This rate also increases if the healthcare system becomes so overwhelmed that some cases cannot be treated.

In general, the global situation has become more severe over the past month. Again, the world is not coming to an end, but it's important to pay attention to the situation and follow the guidelines in place. We've seen what has been happening in countries that were highly proactive (like South Korea) vs. countries that were less so (like the United States).

**Just because you may be young and healthy, you aren't in the clear.** While most deaths have been among older people and those with existing health problems such as a compromised immune system, some younger people have also become badly ill, and regardless, you do not want to spread the virus to more vulnerable populations.

- comparing courses or instructors
- asking about how hard an exam is

But it did. Any thoughts? I think it goes without saying that this is likely going to be disastrous for the undergraduate student body if SSMU doesn't compromise.

Transcript is as follows:

*Dear McGill students,*

*I write today to inform you that the University has made the difficult decision to terminate its current contractual relationship with the Students' Society of McGill University (SSMU). Under the terms of the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between McGill and the SSMU, either party is permitted to end the relationship with no fault assigned, provided that mediation is attempted beforehand. We will, of course, honour that process and engage in it in good faith.*

*That said, I want to be fully transparent with you about why we have taken this step and what it means for you.*

*Let me begin by acknowledging that the SSMU plays an important and historic role in representing undergraduate students at McGill. Many of its services and advocacy initiatives are deeply valued by the community, and several members of the SSMU’s leadership this year have worked hard, in good faith, with the University administration. They have demonstrated a sincere commitment to representing their peers and improving student life for all undergraduates.*

*However, the SSMU’s leadership has been neither unanimous nor explicit in dissociating itself from or rejecting groups without recognized status at McGill that endorse or engage in acts of vandalism, intimidation, and obstruction as forms of activism. We reject this, unequivocally. Protest is indeed part of university life—our policies and the law protect peaceful assembly and freedom of expression. But vandalism, obstruction, threats, and violence do not fall within these protections. They violate our collective values and our policies, and they damage the trust and safety of our community.*

*Last week, SSMU allowed and, at least tacitly, supported a three-day strike that further divided a campus community already deeply cleaved and hurting. The SSMU can and should have ruled the motion that led to the strike referendum as out of order given SSMU’s governing documents, but opted against this. The result was a campus environment in which dozens of classes were blocked or interrupted. Students and instructors were unable to teach or learn. Many felt threatened, intimidated, and unsafe. This culminated in an incident in which individuals smashed a glass office door using a fire hydrant filled with red paint. The paint was sprayed throughout the office while staff were inside. One staff member was hit directly.*

*Let me be clear: No one at McGill—no student, no staff member, no instructor or faculty member—should ever have to experience this at their place of work or study. This behaviour is unacceptable, and I denounce it in the strongest possible terms.*

*These tactics do nothing to support or advance the causes they purport to advance. They divide our community and threaten to foment hate against groups who are already vulnerable.*

*While the SSMU has since issued a statement reaffirming its commitment to peaceful protest and recognizing that some events during the strike turned violent, McGill University remains deeply concerned about the consequences of this strike. A commitment to peaceful protest must be demonstrated not just in words but in practice. The University will continue to prioritize the safety and well-being of all members of our community as we move forward.*

*I am aware that some in our community have viewed McGill's communications as conveying bias in favour of one group or another. I take these concerns seriously and have reflected on them carefully in writing to you today. My goal is not to silence dissent, but to affirm that all students—whatever their identity or politics—deserve to live, learn, and express themselves on a campus free of fear, harassment, or violence, where their dignity is respected.*

*As we move forward, the University will enter the mediation process with SSMU in the spirit of resolution. Should that process not allow us to sustain the MOA, we are fully committed to ensuring that students continue to have strong, democratic representation and uninterrupted access to critical services. The well-being and academic success of all our students will remain our foremost priority.*

*I will continue to keep you informed as we navigate this process. Thank you for your attention, and for your ongoing care for one another in these challenging times.*

*Sincerely,*

*Professor Angela Campbell*

Read about it here:

https://beta.ctvnews.ca/national/canada/2020/4/22/1_4906564.html

It will run from May to August 2020.

The total cost of this welfare program will be $9B.

The Government will also double the Canada Student Grant by $3000. 

Edit:

#FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:

*I preface this FAQ by saying that details are evolving as we go, and this program is not official legislation. The program may change in the final legislative draft and law. This is based on the information that has been released so far on April 22nd, 2020.*

**Who qualifies?**

Based on government sources, you qualify if:

(a) You are a student that will return to school in the Fall of 2020, or

(b) You have graduated, or will graduate in 2020.

and will make less than $1000/month from the months of May to August.

**Can international students apply for this benefit?**

CTV News reports:

>The new funds will be available for Canadians studying in Canada, as well as students who are completing postsecondary schooling abroad, her office clarified. Non-citizens, such as international students, cannot claim the emergency benefit.

Permanent Residents are, however, reportedly eligible.

**Can high school students going into university apply for this benefit?**

There are no firm details on this yet. Some journalists (CBC) are saying that incoming first-year students will qualify.

**Can part-time students apply for this benefit?**

Yes, part-time students can apply.

**How much is the monthly benefit?**

The monthly benefit is $1250/month for eligible students, and $1750/month for students with disabilities or eligible dependents. It will run from May 2020 to August 2020.

**Where do I go to register/apply for this benefit?**

There are no firm details yet. However, the government has said this benefit will be administered through the CRA. This likely means one way to apply will be via the online My CRA account. You can register for a My CRA account [here.](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html) 

**When can I apply for this benefit?**

The program is still not official law. Therefore, the government does not have the program ready yet. Expect to hear more details on when you can apply in early May. In the meantime, make sure you have a My CRA account.

**Do I need to have had a job lined up for the summer to qualify?**

No, you don't need to have had a job or lost your job. If you are a post-secondary student, you can apply.

**Can I still work and apply for this benefit?**

Yes, you can still work and receive the benefit provided that you do not make more than $1000/month.

**What if I am earning a stipend or working via NSERC this summer?** 

This is still unclear. There are no firm details. It will all depend on the definition of ""income"" in the legislation. It may only include employment and/or business income (like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit), and not other forms of non-taxable income like scholarships, stipends or research grants.

**Do I have to have worked last year in the summer to get the benefit?**

No, there is no current 2019 income threshold or work requirement to get this benefit.

**I collect $2,000 a month from the CERB. Can I also collect this benefit?**

No. You either claim the CERB or the CESB, but not both in the same time period.","['grad', 'student', 'count']",,0.0,grad student count
32370,my condolences your father will have helped educate countless people throughout his career and no doubt changed each of their futures for the better,Are there any accounting/business management alumni here from 15+ years ago?,2020-12-15 00:16:02,UofT,Other,"I hope this is okay to ask. This question will be a little odd, but I was just wondering if there are any alums here who would have taken any accounting or business management courses (I think the business management was at the master’s level) from 15+ years ago?

My dad was a prof at UofT (and UTM), Professor Bertrand. He passed away last year and it has hit me incredibly hard. He was my rock, my everything, my person. I guess I wanted to hear if anyone remembers him or has any fun stories. I used to love reading his reviews because a lot of his students seemed to like him.

If anyone here is an alum and took a class that he taught, can you share any fun stories you have? I wish I had more time to ask him about it. He was diagnosed with cancer in April and passed away in September, so it all happened really fast and I was left with so many things I wished I’d asked.

Thanks for any input :)

Edit: I was COMPLETELY UNPREPARED for the response this is getting, thank you so much everyone. I’m going to check out some Facebook UofT Alumni groups too.

I found his ratemyprofessor page and while a lot of people said his voice would put them to sleep (true - I have fallen asleep countless times to him reading me stories), that he really knew his material, never read from notes, and would answer any question anyone had at any time. He loved teaching, so I do hope some people out there remember him.

Thank you everyone, from the bottom of my heart.","['condolence', 'father', 'helped', 'educate', 'countless', 'people', 'throughout', 'career', 'doubt', 'changed', 'future', 'better']",,-0.2023,condolence father helped educate countless people throughout career doubt changed future better
86327,im not a far right wing nut just a socialist god you people are exhausting,Speaking Our Minds at McGill,2023-10-05 17:08:21,McGill,," I'm a liberal Poli Sci student. I've written this post because I don't feel like I can speak my mind at McGill. 

What I've realized is that there is a lot of dogmatism on this campus, particularly concerning issues of social justice. Critiquing any progressive ideas can prompt accusations of bigotry, insensitivity, or even violence. It's easy not to notice this dogmatism because dissent has been discouraged, making some ideas about social justice appear self-evident. 

To be clear, I'm not a far-right wingnut. I'm a democratic socialist who wants an end to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. But I'm also alarmed by the stifling intellectual environment surrounding social justice at McGill. Enforcing ideological purity by shaming dissenters is something I'd expect to come from the far-right, not left-wing McGillians. 

All of the unproductive behaviours I will identify in this post are things I have been personally guilty of. By writing this post, I hope to draw attention to a problem I am partly responsible for.

I've spoken to many left-wing McGillians who feel they can't speak freely about certain progressive ideas, for fear of being labeled bigots. Here are some examples:

* Women who think that aspects of the MeToo movement are overblown or unproductive
* Professors who think that progressive ideas about mental health have created a culture of self-victimization and learned helplessness
* Black students who disagree with elements of recent anti-racist ideas; feel uncomfortable around many progressive white students because they try to acknowledge blackness instead of acting colourblind
* Queer students who feel uncomfortable in the LGBTQ+ movement because of its lack of ideological diversity and expectations surrounding dress, appearance, and tone of voice
* Students who have experienced rape, sexual assault who think that the current approach to sexual violence worsens mental health outcomes
* Science students who are alarmed by the anti-scientific attitudes of some left-wing McGillians, who deny any scientific facts that could potentially be abused for right-wing purposes (such as existence of human nature and innate aggregate sex differences between men and women)
* Liberal students and professors who are concerned about the state of free speech on campuses, but don't want to be seen as right-wingers

These people only shared their views after I made it clear that I wouldn't shame them for their opinions. By approaching political conversations more openly, I realized that many left-wing McGillians disagree with certain progressive ideas, but don't feel comfortable saying so. 

All of this is bad for three reasons. Firstly, we need open discourse in order to expand our minds. Listening to the people who disagree with us, instead of assuming they are bigots because we don't like their views, is a great way to sharpen our political thinking. A broadened perspective is one of the main rewards of a university education, but the current intellectual environment is robbing many of us of this benefit.

Secondly, freedom of speech is important in itself. It's necessary for democracy and good citizenship. How can we properly debate the social and political issues that affect our society if we routinely shame dissenters? Many of the ideas that we consider fundamental to the wellbeing of our society now were controversial a short time ago. 

Finally, closed intellectual environments harm social justice movements, in two ways. Firstly, shutting down dissent alienates potential allies. Shaming others for disagreeing with us is profoundly obnoxious. It communicates moral arrogance and makes others feel unheard and aggrieved. There is a reason the far-right has seized on the issue of free speech on campuses. They know that our approach to speech we disagree with is deeply unpopular.

Secondly, treating progressive ideas as sacrosanct allows bad ideas to flourish, undermining the efficacy of social justice activism. Activists in this environment become less capable of communicating effectively with the public, since their ideas are tailored to people who already agree with them.

I'm confident that leaving space for disagreement would raise the quality of discourse, broaden the minds of students, and strengthen social justice activism. Restoring intellectual openness would benefit all of us. Let's create a campus where we can speak our minds.

Alternatives inside.,2015-12-27 03:31:26,UBC,,"The textbook industry is extortion and racketeering, plain and simple. But there's hope! You can avoid being a victim of the captive market by finding almost any textbook you need online. In my four years at UBC I only bought a handful of books, and those were only necessary because of evil online access codes.

Some of my favorite resources (besides torrents) are:

1. [LibGen](http://gen.lib.rus.ec/): This is quite simply the best resource for finding a free PDF of almost any textbook
2. [Bigwords.com](http://www.bigwords.com/) and [Slugbooks](http://www.slugbooks.com): If you absolutely must buy a book, these websites compare prices to find the cheapest deal
3. [Custom ebook search engine] (https://cse.google.com/cse/publicurl?cx=011394183039475424659:5bfyqg89ers): This indexes a number of well-known book sharing websites.

There are many, many more resources out there, but quite honestly between LibGen, the custom ebook search engine (#3), and torrents (e.g. https://thepiratebay.gd/ or https://kat.cr/), it's unlikely that you will have any difficulty in finding your books.","['bookfi', 'doesnt', 'work', 'anymore']",,0.0,bookfi doesnt work anymore
109477,ah i see good point,An honest confession,2022-11-17 01:46:30,McGill,,"I'm graduating, and I got a job waiting for me, but I have to get this off my chest as a former Teaching Assistant to all the students (especially **continuing studies**).

1. We are students just like you. 
2. You don’t own us. You can't say whatever pops into your head and harass us.
3. You can't email us at 12:30 am and tell us what to do with harsh language and expect a fast response. 
4. Stop being so entitled. Every TA I know is a student who wants to support their studies cause of a lack of financials, so understand them.

It really bothered me during my time here and broke my heart so many times, and I couldn't tell anyone or respond to the students the way I wanted. I'm talking to those from Continuing studies that McGill has no filter of their background. Just because you're older, doesn't mean you can mistreat and harass us.

72063,the frats do be committing psychological warfare against those unwilling and unconsenting to having to witness such a display if they were actually totally naked and didnt cover up at all they could be charged for indecent exposure if police wanted to charge them since ubc is a public place,Bad Experience with Phi Delta Theta Fraternity,2022-03-17 00:44:02,UBC,,"Hello,

I am a former member of the phi delta fraternity from a decade ago and I feel liked since we live in an age of call out culture, and people coming forward with different situations in society in terms of harrassment, abuse, I feel it is my responsibility and duty to come forward with certain experiences.

Look, im not here to bash greek life because I'm obviously aware that to the outside world there's different stereotypes surrounding fraternities so that's for people to have their own debate over because theirs obviously different situations with different organizations so just here to share personal experience. Anyway, when I arrived I felt like I was treated extremely unfairly, judged by the way I talked, acted, dressed. Talked about behind my back and made felt unwelcomed and unbelievably been treated like I was guilty of something I didn't do just because I didn't fit a certain culture. Called a ""faggot"" many times. Told to commit suicide by someone was well.

I decided I was going to give it a try and go forward with the ""pledge process"" and go forward with the initiation which is a story in itself. For a chapter that says in their model, that they are ""anti-hazing"", they force you for 3 days to pretty much go through physical torture with literally no sleep whatsoever, they get all the pledges together and force you in their basement to go through physical torture for pretty much the whole days doing pushups planks sit ups squats all day even though physical exertion, they don't let you leave and even someone who said they had to go to the hospital because they weren't feeling well was called a ""pussy"", they force you to eat marshmallows until your about to throw up which someone did and they force you to walk around with some sort of t-shirt wearing some sort of personal attack on you even if it crosses the line. For example their was an east indian guy who was bald  was forced to wear a derogatory t-shirt that said ""Mr. Cleans Magic Suicide Bomber"". Can you fucking believe that? Plus that east indian guy later that year had a falling out with the fraternity because he didn't like the way someone was being treated so he called the fraternities headquarters to try to report how the fraternity always had alcohol in the house even though they were supposed to be a ""Dry Frat"" (they would lie all the time when then people from the headquarters would come over from their main location in Ohio).

In terms of racism, its ironic that on their social media pages they have all these blacked out posts surrounding the George Floyd situation because in the frats facebook group message board back then, their was a guy who was always being told about how he was a terrorist and how he blew up buildings. In one of their weekly meetings people were giggling and laughing how one of the active members said when he was drunk ""all n\*\*gers should die"".

Misogamy was part of their culture, and the way they would talk about women behind closed doors was absolutely disgusting, ive got some pretty demeaning statements towards women in their group email chats if anyone wants to DM, and its ironic because how they say their celebration women's day in their social media pages and stuff like that. The stuff they would say about women is worse then the Brendan Leipsic situation that we saw play out in the NHL. Every meeting their would be a ""story of the week"" and usually it involved people ""kissing and telling"" certain situations about their encounters with no respect for women even though that stuff should be kept private. They would call a girl who had an an encounter with 3 members of the fraternity as ""phi done with"".

Also connected to that there was an identical ""Logan Mailloux situation"" (some people might be aware of that controversial hockey player who got drafted by the Montreal Canadians this year. Our main alumni guy who was always around the house and took care of certain matters and was a lawyer was freaking out when it happened and so was our main executive group. But the sickening thing about it that they didn't have the guts to expel and ban the members/member who were involved in this incident, they still carried on as members of the chapter for another 2 years. You would think that an organization just like any sports organization or workplace in society would have a NO TOLERANCE stance on sex abuse, but this just blew my mind how they did nothing about this situation.

&#x200B;

The irony of them talking about on their social media pages about mental health is that everyday was mental warfare for me and there was no one to ask for help. If you didn't stand up for you would be considered soft. They called me simple and retarded everyday. They made up lies about my GPA or said I was struggling in school (Who the fuck tries to point fun on someone's struggles even if they were). They doubled down on a lot of my personal problems. I would get a dirty look and mean stare down whenever I would see the members walking around campus and even in their own house.  I always heard from their members about me ""how the fuck could you initiate this guy so and so. They tried to blame me for not ""Contributing anything to the chapter"" even though I had done pretty much absolutely nothing wrong, (i paid my dues to become a member a i paid a full year of housing rent the following rent- i tried giving the organization another chance by living there)  yes I had the choice to leave and I regret not leaving much earlier (i left in 2012) but its not my fault I was subject to this type of torture considering all of the ""high morals"" they place on this organization on their social media and website. Even when I left, people were talking shit about me to future people who joined and other people about UBC or even when I was walking around campus or on their facebook pages.

&#x200B;

I've made a bunch of complaints the past recently to their headquarters in Ohio, talked to UBC admin, ubc investigations staff,  the IFC president, reached out to the ubyssey, tried to reach out to former members who were ""redlined"" or left the chapter on bad terms to back up my claims, tried to reach out to President Ono and have some zoom meeting scheduled with people who work at UBC later this week. Even have talked to a few lawyers about different things and options. In conclusion, like I'll reiterate im not making a broad statement about frats in general, but considering the age we live in of call out culture and especially the past 4-5 years with situations like the harvey weinstein situation, the Akim Aliu situation and Mike Babcock and Kyle Beach situation in the NHL. I have to do what's right because it definitely has had an effect on my life even today. I don't want anybody to go through what I had to.","['frat', 'committing', 'psychological', 'warfare', 'unwilling', 'unconsenting', 'witness', 'display', 'actually', 'totally', 'naked', 'didnt', 'cover', 'could', 'charged', 'indecent', 'exposure', 'police', 'wanted', 'charge', 'since', 'ubc', 'public', 'place']",,-0.4019,frat committing psychological warfare unwilling unconsenting witness display actually totally naked didnt cover could charged indecent exposure police wanted charge since ubc public place

101189,theres a difference between having a nuanced opinion and directly advocating for violence against the jews honestly,The year is 2026,2024-07-26 14:52:59,McGill,,"The war for campus rages on. The SSMU Vice-President for War has recently signed a defense pact with the New Encampment Junta against Supreme Leader Saini. Multiple faculties now stand in ruins due to the constant shelling. After the March Rebellion, the entirety of the Law Faculty was exterminated by Sainist forces.

I head to campus for my morning lecture. At the first checkpoint, an armed guard scans my forearm - we all got a barcode tattooed on us last year. I wait 20 minutes at the border checkpoint for the secondary pat-down and K9 check for bombs, trying to ignore the grad student loudly dying of tuberculosis in front of me. After the patdown, I then have to cross 4 more military checkpoints to make it to my lecture - how dehumanizing!

Armed guards stand at the front of the lecture hall ready to shoot the professor the second he makes an anti-Sainist comment. Today, only 2 suicide bombers interrupted the lecture, so I actually got to learn some material. After the lecture, I go to study at the library with my one friend; gatherings of more than 2 were banned earlier this year. I walk past all of the empty shelves where now-censored books once stood, not that anybody is allowed to check out books anymore.

Suddenly, we hear the air raid siren. The New Encampment Junta must be launching a new wave of rockets towards campus. We drop everything to run to the closest bomb shelter where the Cyberthèque once was. We're stopped at the entrance of the shelter, another checkpoint. At this point, I think I've heard ""Can I see your ID?"" more than any other sentence in my life.

Suddenly, an image flashes into my head - my ID, at the table in the library, left behind. The guard pushes me away from the bomb shelter. ""The bomb shelters are for McGill students and staff only,"" he yells. Defeated, I go to sit on the grass near where Rodick Gate once stood, as I watch the rockets streak through the sky.

78892,hey anychance you have this textbook downloaded on you that you could send my way,Reminder as we start a new semester: don't buy textbooks if you don't have to! Alternatives inside.,2015-12-27 03:31:26,UBC,,"The textbook industry is extortion and racketeering, plain and simple. But there's hope! You can avoid being a victim of the captive market by finding almost any textbook you need online. In my four years at UBC I only bought a handful of books, and those were only necessary because of evil online access codes.

Some of my favorite resources (besides torrents) are:

1. [LibGen](http://gen.lib.rus.ec/): This is quite simply the best resource for finding a free PDF of almost any textbook
2. [Bigwords.com](http://www.bigwords.com/) and [Slugbooks](http://www.slugbooks.com): If you absolutely must buy a book, these websites compare prices to find the cheapest deal
3. [Custom ebook search engine] (https://cse.google.com/cse/publicurl?cx=011394183039475424659:5bfyqg89ers): This indexes a number of well-known book sharing websites. List of all the sites it indexes can be found [here](http://pastebin.com/62tKNmm1). Credit to /u/Amosqu for making the custom search.

10. [Abebooks.com](http://www.abebooks.com/) Excellent resource for finding physical copies of textbooks sold internationally for a tiny fraction of the price. Credit to /u/DrSloan for finding this one.

There are many, many more resources out there, but quite honestly between LibGen, the custom ebook search engine (#3), and torrents (e.g. https://thepiratebay.gd/ or https://kat.cr/), it's unlikely that you will have any difficulty in finding your books.","['hey', 'anychance', 'textbook', 'downloaded', 'could', 'send', 'way']",,0.0,hey anychance textbook downloaded could send way

Even when I mute and unmute myself to speak, their yelling is so loud that it overpowers my voice.

Now, I've taken to skipping meetings completely when the yelling begins so I can avoid my group members asking me awkward questions. A side effect of that is my group now thinks I can never attend meetings on time because I'm lazy. Sometimes I think I should just suck it up and deflect the questions, but it makes me feel horrible to be asked. I can never escape the sounds either because I live in a small-ish apartment. 

I try to do my share of the work, I message the group chat and say I'll take whatever portion of work they assign to me. But it's still a horrible situation.

94936,quality of instruction idk but grades are through the roof since last march,McGill is forcing departments to have 25-50% students in in-person classes for winter 2020,2020-10-30 20:45:09,McGill,,"We got this email this morning, and the general consensus among the profs and grad students is outrage about how ridiculous this is. There isn't enough time to reorganize courses so that it is taught in person, let alone plan out how this can be done safely. It seems like this is done because McGill is seeing more people taking the winter semester off and this last minute and dangerous course change is done solely for $$$.


>Dear all,
>
At today’s Faculty of Science Town Hall it was announced that McGill plans to roll out - as much as possible -l in-person, on-campus teaching activities starting in January 2021.
>
Chairs have been asked to submit a list of teachable courses, to be finalized by Tuesday next week.
>
After a pre-screening with associate deans we have assessed the courses highlighted in yellow (table below) as potentially and partially teachable on campus. This assessment was targeting courses in the intermediate enrollment range (about 20-100). Larger courses should check if some elements (e.g., tutorials) might be offered on campus.
>
This is a very sudden development and probably unexpected with the background of the extended red alert situation in the Montreal region.

Edit: This was an email sent to the profs and graduate students in order to gauge the mood and plan the list to send to the faculty.

17895,congrats on your graduation i agree i still struggle with comparing myself to others,From F’s to Straight A’s: How I Went From Academic Suspension to a Near 4.0,2019-10-24 04:17:01,UofT,Other,"In light of recent happenings at UofT surrounding mental health, I’d thought I’d share my journey in overcoming my own MH issues, and hopefully lending a helping hand to those who may be in a similar situation

Here’s a snapshot of my first semester at UofT compared to my latest Summer semester grades.

https://i.redd.it/l1rc7ekpxeu31.jpg

Putting it lightly, my first year (I’m in life sci) was an absolute shit show. I failed a lot of my courses and barely passed the others. I was, unbeknownst to myself, struggling with severe depression and loneliness that followed me from high school. Being as my family had moved away and I struggled to make any friends, I spent most of my days alone, even while living on res. I would go days without speaking to anyone besides family without even noticing it.

Eventually, I finished 1st year and was placed on academic probation. I thought that over the summer I’d be able to somehow get my shit together, but my ‘second year’ was even worse. Ultimately, I was placed on academic suspension for a year.

At this point, without disclosing too much, I decided to seek professional help. This took care of a lot of my issues, but I still felt very unmotivated. What really made the biggest difference for me was having a serious talk with myself about what I wanted to do with my life. Why did I choose to go to UofT? What am I even studying all this? 

I realized I was living life without *intention*. 

I knew I wanted to do something great. And I somehow knew that I was in the right school and this degree would ultimately help me. But I wasn’t fully committed to making that happen. My focus was skewed (or simply non-existent). Let me tell you, the greatest thing to ever happen to me in my academic career was getting suspended. Not only did it act as a wake-up call, but it allowed me to take a step back and perform a diagnostic check on myself. 

With a refreshed mindset and proper MH treatment, I was able to come back to UofT and for once feel like a student, not a failure.

For anyone whose struggling to find hope or believe they’re too far gone, it’s never too late. I still struggle today as a 3/4th year student but I’ve learned to recognize my warning signs and overcome them.

Here’s some tips from what I learned these past few years: 

1. The first step in getting any help is actually *recognizing* you need it. There is no shame in asking for it. A lot of mental illnesses actually make you believe you don't have them and instead your issues are attributed to laziness. If you have an inkling, you're probably right.
2. Encourage yourself to take a step back every now and then to self-check. Ask yourself how you’re doing. What do you need? Why do you need it? What can you do to make yourself feel better? 
3. Try to gain some practical experience by volunteering, interning, or even working. During my suspension year I started volunteering at a hospital. This role not only solidified that I did not want to pursue a medical career, but also aided greatly in my recovery. Sometimes, having a repetitive job/task can train you in developing self-regulatory skills like time management (while gaining useful experience). 
4. UofT is not for everyone, and that's okay. If you are seriously struggling academically at UofT, try looking at other programs, universities, or colleges. You may be better suited for a practical profession. Don’t torture yourself by studying something you’re not passionate or interested in.
5. Accessibility Services has saved my life. If you believe you're struggling with a disability (mental or physical), no matter how major or minor, book an appointment with an advisor. You don't need to be diagnosed with 10 different disorders to be accommodated.
6. On the same note, your college/faculty has a bunch of resources that I’ve used over these years, namely Learning Specialists. Even a single meeting can provide you with valuable tips on how to build an effective study plan.
7. Speaking of study plans, try to find a method of taking notes that works best for you. I started out handwriting notes, but found that it really discouraged me from studying because it would take forever to create them. I now type notes, print them, and revise with a whiteboard. Everybody learns differently.
8. Don’t feel pressured to take a full course load. I find that taking a reduced course load in the fall/winter plus summer school works best for me. This way I don’t feel overwhelmed. 
9. Also, do not feel pressured to complete your degree in 4 years. I’m entering my 3rd year of study, but my 5th year at UofT. It‘s a little disheartening and tough to see my peers graduating, but I know that I’m putting myself first and that’s all that matters. I’d rather gain valuable experience and improve my GPA than to finish “on-time” with a shitty one.
10. Lastly, take care of yourself. It’s very redundant to say, but it’s extremely important to recognize signs of burnout or mental exhaustion. Listen to your body and mind.

I hope that someone can take hope from this all. As always, my DM’s are open if anyone wants a chat. 

Take care! Be strong! You got this!

TL;DR: Failed my first couple years. Took care of my mental health and perspective. Came back with straight A’s.

Edit: Thank you everyone for the kind words. As mentioned, my most recent grades are from Summer courses, which I agree are generally easier to do well in. However, I usually take 4-5 courses in the regular school year and perform similarity as well. Also, I completely understand and respect that not everyone has access to the opportunities and decisions I was able to take. In that case, I hope that I was able to at least give you some hope in knowing that there’s always light at the end of the tunnel. I wish you all the best, and thank you once again!","['congrats', 'graduation', 'agree', 'still', 'struggle', 'comparing', 'others']",,0.5574,congrats graduation agree still struggle comparing others

I am a PhD student at UBC and I get a stipend of around $2000 per month. My rent is $1300 and my monthly groceries are $400. Add to this the health insurance of $75, the phone bill of $50, and the freakin' coin laundry bill of $20. I am a human too so I go out on some weekends and let's add a miscellaneous budget of $100 per month. All of this totals to $1945.

So am I saving $55 a month? Heck no! I need to pay the tuition fee which averages to $500 a month. There you go, I am cashflow negative, let alone saving peanuts.

I take COVID very seriously. I've known people who have died from COVID. It is very serious, very real, and potentially deadly.

With the new Omicron variant going around, I understand why so many student's are pushing for online exams. I am too. We're pushing a lot of blame towards the heads of UBC, and while we have every right to be upset with them, our professors have a say in this too. In one of my piazza classes' when a student asked what to do if they don't feel comfortable coming to in person exams, the professor replied with ""you can bring your own hand sanitizer, and wash your hands before and after."" I'm sorry but what the actual fuck.

If you're sick or test positive for COVID, the only option is to wait like 4 months to do it deferred. For people who have already put in the money for tutoring, spent the past month prepping for this exam, and taken the time off, this makes zero sense. I don't understand why it's so difficult to give students an online option to prevent sick people showing up to exams. And to the sick people showing up, I don't blame you, nor am I upset with you! It's not your fault you've been put in a tricky position. I'm ashamed to say that I would do the same.

UBC professors who may see this, give students the option of online exams! You can enforce different policies for the online exams, such as no bell curving, less time, camera must be on, etc to prevent cheating. At this point, it seems as though UBC cares more about convenience than preventing sickness.

UBC res sent out emails this morning saying they're providing more rapid testing - but guess what, that isn't going to do anything!! If people weren't getting tested before, they aren't going to get tested now. And even if they are, they'll do it after the exams. I was considering getting tested today, just to ensure I'm not carrying anything before entering a room full of 800 people, but then I was struck with the realization that if it's positive, I won't be able to attend exams. I'm getting tested after exams before seeing my family for the holidays.

Anyways, feel free to downvote into oblivion, I made a new account for this post. I'm just so upset about the whole situation. Also, to the people saying the people who want online exams just want to cheat... sure maybe there's a few. I'm fully studied and prepared for every one of my exams, but I am not prepared for the additional anxiety of sitting beside people who are coughing up phlegm <3","['well', 'said', 'good', 'reason', 'keeping', 'status', 'quo', 'ubc', 'need', 'act', 'like', 'leading', 'university', 'pivot', 'final', 'mean', 'class', 'online', 'january', 'mean', 'administration', 'monitor', 'prepared', 'implement', 'contingency', 'plan', 'quickly', 'cornell', 'test', 'positive', 'shut', 'ubc', 'testing', 'never', 'able', 'respond', 'way', 'best', 'interest', 'student']",,0.9517,well said good reason keeping status quo ubc need act like leading university pivot final mean class online january mean administration monitor prepared implement contingency plan quickly cornell test positive shut ubc testing never able respond way best interest student

I also have barely taken part in any clubs or extracurriculars because everything has been online for the past two years and I had no motivation to join anything. I am beginning to regret all my decisions over the past four years. I can't even begin to describe how inferior and insecure I feel compared to everyone here.

I am applying for grad school but in a completely different program that will actually get me a job but I still feel like a failure for wasting the past four years of my life.

The nearest restroom seemed miles away, and my stomach had its own sense of urgency.

Don’t be like me, ask for help when you need it. Thanks for all the advice.

I am ashamed to post this, but I am in distress and in need of some advice.

I had an essay worth 30% due on August 12, but to this day I still haven’t submitted it nor have I reached out to the professor for an extension. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but for the past two weeks I haven’t been able to focus on anything at all. My thoughts are all jumbled up and it’s been near impossible for me to sit down and write. I’ve been so stressed over this that I’m losing sleep and eating less. I think I might have undiagnosed ADHD or something, but I’m not sure. I was doing well in this course, but now I wasted 30% all because I fucked up and procrastinated.

I don’t know what to do. Should I reach out to my professor? To the registrar? Should I petition for a late term work submission? To be completely honest, I am terrified to reach out to my professor since it’s so late. But, if I petition, I am afraid that it would be rejected since I don’t have any adequate supporting documentation. 

I would really appreciate the help. Thank you in advance.","['really', 'lack', 'recognizing', 'hardship', 'others', 'attempt', 'sarcastim', 'like', 'adhd', 'permanently', 'disabled', 'actually', 'disable', 'many', 'people', 'recognized', 'permanent', 'disability', 'many', 'country', 'therefore', 'relevant', 'conversation']",,0.5673,really lack recognizing hardship others attempt sarcastim like adhd permanently disabled actually disable many people recognized permanent disability many country therefore relevant conversation

58165,here take my upvote and leave me alone to go over my pessimistic thoughts,"Four years ago today, I was offered admission to UBC",2022-04-05 04:41:38,UBC,Prose,"It sounded crazy to me that I was going to be studying in Canada for real. My parents had been preparing me for quite a few years, but when it came true, I was kinda overwhelmed by all the possibilities.


UBC was not my dream school. I set UBC as my goal because everyone told me it was good, and since the famous sinologist Timothy Brook taught at UBC, I was persuaded (sadly I've never had a chance to take his course). It was a huge relief when I received the admission offer. There was finally a decent place for me to go.


The first morning I arrived in Vancouver, I lost one of my suitcases at YVR airport. I only had two, containing everything that I needed to start a new life in a foreign country. I had never lived in a foreign place before, and I had never lived without my parents by my side. That suitcase was freaking important, but I was not worried at all. It was raining that day. The forest and the sea together looked like a traditional painting with its ink still wet, and I was enchanted by the scenery, forgetting everything about the suitcase. UBC was so beautiful, and I was thrilled to enter a new phase of life. I thought everything could happen in this beautiful place.


It was indeed not bad. In my four undergrad years, I met so many people from all over the world. I played with real snow every winter. I enjoyed the campus, one of the most beautiful places I've ever been to. I had the best roomies in the world. I made many new friends and I cherish them. I got to live in a residence studio with a fantastic view of the sea. Most importantly, I chose my favorite major and learned everything that interested me. But I feel like something is missing, that I haven't done anything at all and four years passed and now I'm facing graduation.


What did I miss? Parties? Storm the Wall? Co-op? More academic challenges, or more relationships? I don't know. Was there a checklist given to me when I entered UBC, stating that only the completion of this list will bring you fulfillment as an undergrad? Probably. But I doubt if I would feel fulfilled even after completing that list. Is it all Covid's fault? Maybe, but still, I doubt if I would feel any better if Covid never happened. There is always something missing in my life, and without me realizing what that is, time drags me forward, and I've accepted that as the reality of life.


&nbsp;


When I was in primary school, a wall right beside a tall climbing frame was the limit of our schoolyard. If you climb to the top you can see what was outside the wall – a river, a line of poplar trees on the other side of the river, and on the riverbank on this side was a field of weeds that blossomed yellow in spring. My classmate told me that these tall grasses with tiny yellow flowers were called Canadian goldenrods. Canadian goldenrod was a common invasive species in my city, and its Chinese name is strangely straightforward, like a line from an uncompleted couplet in traditional poetry, so it stuck in my mind. The idea that these weed flowers were from Canada was fascinating to me, so I often clung to the top of the climbing frame and gazed at those flowers, imagining that on a distant, distant land, on the other side of the Earth, the same flowers blossomed in a similar yellow field. I thought maybe they blossomed all over Canada. A place that far away was unfathomable to me as a kid.


I don't think I've noticed any Canadian goldenrod ever since I came here. Nothing quite matched my imagination about Canada; I thought it would be a very foreign and exotic place, but besides being beautiful, Vancouver was just like any other city, and I fit in without any problems, a great anticlimax to the legend of Canadian goldenrods. The university was kind of an anticlimax as well, it was... not as exciting as I had expected.


I can't even remember what I was expecting when I first came here, but I know it was not the life I'm having right now. And I still don't know what I'm missing.


Exactly a month ago, I accepted another admission offer from UBC. I'm going to be staying in this school as a graduate student for another few years. Without me noticing it, I've grown used to this school and this city, as if I belong here while I don't, and terrifyingly I've grown into an adult meanwhile. While my identity is forming, UBC and Vancouver have sneakily become part of it, and it feels as weird as realizing that a Canadian goldenrod has grown inside of me, inside of that void of a missing life.


Now that I'm used to this place, I'm not expecting a lot for my graduate years. Sometimes I wonder if it's all a dream. That I will wake up at my tiny desk in my primary school, and run out of the building to the climbing frame with my classmates. I will tell them that I've had a crazy dream, in which I grew into an adult and lived alone and was studying far away at a big university in Canada; and I was a good student! I will climb to the top and point to the world outside.


Look!


I will say.


A field of Canadian goldenrods!

I’ve literally HAD nightmares about this. And today it happened. My phone died and none of my alarms rang and I woke up halfway through the exam and ran for my life. Never have I ever been late for an exam in my entire undergrad career.

I write with the center for accessibility and when I got there, they told me they couldn’t let me take the exam (even though there was time remaining). And then I started crying and panicking and they told me to leave (in a polite way I guess but still) and offered little to no help. I was absolutely BAWLING  my eyes out and hyperventilating walking across campus in no particular direction with people staring at me. My life was flashing before my eyes.

And then an adrenaline rush kicked in and I ran all over the campus trying to track my down my prof and found them. They were so kind and understanding and helped me calm down and made me eat something and drink water and take a walk. And then they let me write the exam in their office with my extended time and stayed there with me the entire time.

Not to be dramatic but they literally saved my life. I am super prone to panic attacks and this term has already been difficult due to suicidal ideation, and while it may seem over the top to some, I was really seriously contemplating harming myself for a moment because I felt so defeated and this was the last straw. I definitely have a lot of work to do in separating my intrinsic self worth from school and today really showed me that. So I am just really, really full of gratitude for what they did for me today. They did more for me in that difficult moment than they can ever know.","['never', 'went', 'hospitaldoctor', 'either', 'concussion', 'sort', 'neck', 'injury', 'looking', 'driver', 'got', 'rear', 'ended', 'neck', 'got', 'wrenched', 'pretty', 'badly', 'though', 'didnt', 'feel', 'bad', 'time', 'migraine', 'next', 'day', 'ive', 'several', 'concussion', 'sportsstupidity', 'would', 'last', 'one', 'whatever', 'significantly', 'worse', 'others']",,-0.6558,never went hospitaldoctor either concussion sort neck injury looking driver got rear ended neck got wrenched pretty badly though didnt feel bad time migraine next day ive several concussion sportsstupidity would last one whatever significantly worse others

I am trying to shed some light on the current situation in Orchard Commons. We continue to have large parties in our buildings, putting the safety of residents and staff in jeopardy. Athletes continue to host and attend large parties, both against the provincial COVID-19 orders and UBC Housing rules. 

* Men's and Women's Track and Field/Cross Country has had parties of 15+ people this week with no masks
* Women's Hockey also is holding and attending large parties within our building.

With the P1 variant, we need to take additional precautions. These two teams have shown blatant disregard and/or do not care.

I suggest that these teams are removed from Orchard Commons as they pose a dangerous threat to the rest of us, students. Coaches should remove these students from all practices and games (if they are happening) because they now threaten infecting other athletes. UBC administration should investigate these incidents, and all students who attend a large gathering (15-20+ people) should receive non-academic misconduct penalties.

Follow the rules, please.

I am a PhD student at UBC and I get a stipend of around $2000 per month. My rent is $1300 and my monthly groceries are $400. Add to this the health insurance of $75, the phone bill of $50, and the freakin' coin laundry bill of $20. I am a human too so I go out on some weekends and let's add a miscellaneous budget of $100 per month. All of this totals to $1945.

So am I saving $55 a month? Heck no! I need to pay the tuition fee which averages to $500 a month. There you go, I am cashflow negative, let alone saving peanuts.

The point of this post is to get an idea of how other grad students at UBC are staying afloat. If you are a grad student, please share your story here. If you are an undergrad who is willing to pursue a PhD, DO NOT apply to UBC, just apply to universities in the US or EU.

41724,the one at northrop fryes mcdonalds ofc,"The best chicken nuggets in town, according to math",2022-01-25 22:05:07,UofT,Discussion,"Mkay so I've been trying to figure out what are the best nuggs in town. You know the drill: New year = New me. Can't keep running solely on McNuggets in 2022!!

I primarily focused on fast food nuggets to ensure my top picks are widely accessible to everyone. Gotta say there are some strong local contenders like PG Clucks, Dave's Hot Chicken, Church's Chicken, amongst others. Unfortunately these either have only spare locations, or don't have nuggs but rather other pieces of chicken. We want nuggs.

The contestants considered in this study were: 

1. Harvey's (representing corporate Canada)

2. McDonald's (representing corporate America)

3. Wendy's (a Reddit favourite)

4. Burger King (The only standing monarchy in Toronto)

5. Popeyes (enough said)

6. ChicFilA (hope you don't crave nuggs on a Sunday)

7. Janes (for the stay at home crowd)

I browsed thru all of their nutritional websites to gather their Fat / Protein / Carbs composition, and then made some basic assumptions:

* Every gram of fat represents 9 cals, every gram of protein represents 4 cals, and every gram of carbs represents 4 cals. [Source: USDA](https://www.nal.usda.gov/legacy/fnic/how-many-calories-are-one-gram-fat-carbohydrate-or-protein#:~:text=Information%20for%20Researchers-,How%20many%20calories%20are%20in%20one%20gram%20of%20fat%2C%20carbohydrate,provides%209%20calories%20per%20gram.)
* All carbs in a nugg are attributed to the breading, given that skinless chicken has no carbs. [Source](https://www.verywellfit.com/how-many-calories-in-chicken-breast-3495665)
* Chicken has a protein-to-fat ratio of roughly 8.61 [Source](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/calories-in-chicken#cooking-methods)
* Any fat content beyond that expected based on the protein content and the established protein-to-fat ratio is attributed to oil, a product of the deep frying processes every nugg must endure

So with all of that in mind, I present to you the [official results](https://i.imgur.com/Hfjk44V.png). Wendy's takes home the BEST VALUE award as they serve the most chicken per $. ChicFilA takes home the BEST COMPOSITION award as their nuggs have the highest chicken content (they do feel pretty healthy). 

Harvey's has the worst composition, with the least amount of chicken per nugg out of the cohort (I personally thought BK would be the worst, their nuggs feel like all breading). Somewhat surprisingly, Janes (frozen nuggs) is the worst value, you'd think making nuggs at home would result in better economics but unfortunately we are all better off walking to a fast food restaurant. 

DISCLAIMER: These numbers are based on the nutritional information each of these restaurants/brands claim on their website. There will always be slight discrepancies and variances in real life (maybe we will measure nuggs next week to see how much their weight varies versus what's claimed?).

2. If you can't or don't want to wear a mask, cover your mouth and your nose. Cough and sneeze into your arm or your hands -- if you have portable antibacterial to wash up afterwards.

70036,how is he an intellectual fraud,I'm afraid to speak my mind at UBC,2020-08-04 17:09:12,UBC,Discussion,"Hi all, I'm writing to express my perspective as a UBC faculty member on talking about politically charged ideas on campus. UBC's values emphasize equity and inclusion, which I fully support. I would like to engage, and be part of this effort, but I’m afraid to. This is **not** a far-right post purporting to support free speech but actually advocating for bigotry - I don't identify with those perspectives at all and I believe they are very harmful. Rather, I consider myself fairly liberal, but I get the impression that I'm not always ""liberal enough"" to freely express my views at UBC and that, if I do, my career might be negatively impacted. (I’m posting this with some trepidation and am grateful for the anonymity.) This post, then, is about my worry that the university's approach to these issues might be backfiring: by being too forceful, we are shutting down debates and making many potential allies feel alienated and unsafe about expressing their views. And we really need these allies on board championing equity and inclusion.

As a concrete example, I've been thinking a lot about the [recent events surrounding UBC's board chair](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/michael-korenberg-resigns-ubc-1.5621268). (Note: I don't have any extra information here beyond what I've seen in the news.) My impression is that this person was not a good fit for the job and UBC is better off finding someone whose values are better aligned with the university's values. Truly, I can't understand why someone in that position would show up to a meeting wearing a MAGA hat or go around liking those tweets - both because I can't understand supporting those causes and because it seems obvious that these actions would be inflammatory. However, I'm not sure it was appropriate to completely throw this person under the bus; to me at least, it sends a message (true or not) that conservative views are not tolerated at UBC and one's tenure at UBC may not outlive one's expression of these views. And I am being literal here - I am a bit troubled and actually *not sure* how to handle such situations - that is not a euphemism for disagreement. In my state of being unsure, some discussion would be great. Unfortunately, I’m worried that expressing any view other than ""good riddance!""  might lead to trouble for me. I have heard several stories about folks being shamed or intensely criticized for expressing the ""wrong"" views. (Am I exaggerating about this trouble? I am basing these worries on my own observations, but still, maybe this is all in my head, or maybe I’m particularly sensitive or risk-averse. So I should add a reminder that all this is just one person’s perspective.) 

A problem with keeping quiet is that, across a broad range of issues, my inner mental state and what I would need to say in public are drifting apart. From talking to others, I think this is very common at UBC. Here is what I've observed: outwardly, most people follow the party line, and so it looks like we're doing well at promoting equity and inclusion. But in reality, from what I can gather based on private conversations, peoples' inner thoughts vary widely. I've heard about extreme cases where people post something on social media and then, in private, say the exact opposite. In the short term, this system works: things are getting better because some bad behaviour is genuinely being eliminated. But I don't think this is going to work long term if we're fostering a fear-fuelled theatre of tolerance rather than actual tolerance. This really worries me.

Part of the reason I feel unsafe engaging in these issues is that it's not at all clear to me what is OK and what is not OK at UBC. Some things are obvious: bigotry is not tolerated and should not be tolerated. But some things are very muddy and nuanced. For example, it seems that supporting the current U.S. administration is not permitted (see above) and that criticizing the current U.S. administration is fine. However, criticizing some other countries' governments is actually not OK (I have been told), because it can lead to folks (e.g. international students) from those countries feeling unwelcome and can fan the flames of xenophobia. Perhaps there are some other governments beyond the U.S. that we can openly criticize - I don't know. It feels like there's a set of unwritten rules of what is/isn’t ""allowed"" at UBC, but nobody has told me the rules. And if these rules are hard for me, as someone who has been around here for a while, I can only imagine what it would be like for the new folks joining UBC each year, especially from other countries or cultures. It feels like we're inviting people into a minefield of these unwritten rules - sort of like inviting someone to a dinner party without telling them about the dress code. My goal here is not to criticize these rules; in fact, many of them make sense to me. But rather, my concern is that the rules are really complicated and haven't been clearly communicated - and that the consequences for violating the rules can sometimes be serious. This is a bad combination that stokes my fear of engaging in conversation. 

From my standpoint as a faculty member, I have some thoughts on how we might improve the situation. I suggest trying to bridge the gap between different views, by engaging each other in conversation rather than shutting people down or shaming them. When we hear true intolerance, we need to stop it in its tracks. When we hear questions about process, or why things are a certain way, or genuine struggles with inclusion -- in other words good faith discussion and engagement -- a safety net is needed; this type of engagement should not put one's reputation at risk. 

I think this messaging needs to come from the top. Even one message from a high-up UBC authority could make me feel a lot more safe and accepted. Something along the lines of, ""We expect everyone at UBC to act according to our UBC Code of Conduct [or equivalent document], and this is non-negotiable. This won't be easy for everyone, and that's OK. We understand that different members of the UBC community will have different perspectives, and we welcome discussion on these difficult issues. We don't have all the answers and we, the UBC leadership, may benefit from talking to you as much as you would benefit from talking to us."" The idea here is to combine clarity (link to Code of Conduct), firmness (it's non-negotiable), understanding (this won't be easy for everyone, and that's OK), and some humility (we're doing our best, but we don't have all the answers). 

I think UBC's Equity & Inclusion Office also plays an important role here. In my limited interactions with this office, it is staffed by extremely professional, competent, liberal individuals. What about finding some conservative-leaning staff or running some workshops about the struggles to embrace UBC's worldview for folks coming from very different perspectives? To me at least that would be so powerful, and very inclusive; it would show that conservative folks aren't by default considered bad people, and that even if some of their values don't align with UBC's values, we still want to talk to them. Second, in the various equity and inclusion workshops and training sessions offered for faculty, I would add in the opportunity to challenge the prevailing views. From what I've seen, these workshops are often framed as showing us the ""correct"" way to act and to be. I don't think that works. There are a lot of really sensitive issues at play here - for example, should we consider a person's gender or race when hiring faculty or admitting students - and if so, how? I think these issues are too difficult to be solved without discussion. 

Once again, I am not trying to argue for ""anything goes"" free speech or downsizing our efforts toward a more equitable and inclusive campus. Rather, I'm arguing for realigning our efforts on this front to engage people more genuinely. If I can't express my doubts, nobody will know to address them, and they will linger or fester. I suspect there's a large untapped resource of people at UBC who, like me, want to do more but are disengaging out of fear, frustration, or disillusionment. I would love to open myself up as an ally for UBC's values without fear of a misstep.

-----

**Update**: thank you for all the discussion. I learned a lot from reading the responses and reflecting. This was more or less my first time engaging in a discussion like this outside of private conversations. 

I did not realize students were aware of Michael Korenberg and his views while he was in office, though this seems obvious in hindsight. I hadn't heard of him until he resigned and I saw the news, which likely made it more jarring for me. I feel more at ease about this now. As mentioned in one of my replies below, I would still advocate for some accompanying wording about how career repercussions for political views are reserved for extreme cases (and I'm on board with this being a legitimate extreme case). It's hard to know how much to generalize from myself to others, but I suspect such a sentiment might put a lot of people at ease.

Another follow-up thought is that it seems like one's personal and professional personas are increasingly merged. For example, I know many academics for whom Twitter is a crucial tool to their career development. I don't know any academics who have separate personal and professional social media identities though. And even if they did, people at work could find their personal accounts. I think this complicates matters, because the realms of public and private are increasingly blurred. I don't have any suggestions for what to do about it.

Thanks for the references to the [paradox of tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance). I had heard of it but not engaged with it as much in the past as now. I support being intolerant of intolerance. My lingering concern is that it's very hard to know where the line is, beyond which something is considered intolerance at UBC. As discussed in my post, sometimes it's obvious (e.g. some of the views Korenberg liked on Twitter) but sometimes I feel it's quite tricky. From what I can gather, the boundary depends not just on the message, but also the medium, the context, the person’s role, and probably more. For example, what if the UBC Board Chair had a sign on their front lawn supporting a Conservative candidate before an election? What about a faculty member expressing doubt, at a faculty meeting, about whether certain pro-inclusion practices are effective? It seems like those should be OK, right? It's all very tricky.

Finally, my post focussed mostly on feeling afraid and unsafe, but I should admit to feeling some frustration as well. Personally, I feel I've grown a lot from being at UBC - first learning about equity and inclusion issues, and more recently trying to stand up for equity and inclusion when opportunities arise. But I still don't fully feel a sense of belonging at UBC. When I have doubts about these types of issues, I feel my concerns are unwelcome. Hard to say if this is caused by my own issues vs. the culture at UBC, though. In any case, this conversation has diminished my frustration somewhat, so thanks again.","['intellectual', 'fraud']",,-0.128,intellectual fraud

1413,repetitive comment but calories,I walked from McMaster to UTSG (72km and 100k steps) in 16 hours and 45 minutes with almost no resting breaks during exam season,2025-04-16 00:35:27,UofT,Health,"I left my res at 11:45AM on Sunday (April 13) and arrived at New College by 4:30AM the following day (April 14). Upon departing, the estimated time of arrival was 15 hours and 45 minutes. My moving time ended up being 15 hours and 15 minutes, and the elapsed time was 16 hours and 45 minutes. I forgot to record on Strava upon exiting, so I hit start near MUSC and the parking lot at 11:49AM.

u/Vegetable-Anybody112 had been on my ass to replicate his[ journey from UofT to Mac](https://www.reddit.com/r/McMaster/comments/1gheive/i_walked_80km_and_107000_steps_to_mcmaster_from/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), but in reverse, for ages. After a ton of positive peer pressure and plotting, I figured it was now or never before the official end of my first year. My exam schedule was spaced out nicely with basically one exam a week, so this ended up working out, even last-minute.

I boldly told him that if I were to do it, unlike him, I'd do it without stopping. I grew up with a competitive nature and versatile athletic background until COVID rendered me a couch potato. But I did it. I walked from McMaster to UTSG (New College specifically): 72km and 100k steps in under 17 hours with hardly any real resting breaks, a step length ranging from 46–83 cm, and standing at just 5’1-5’2. Not once did I idle apart from when I had to at crosswalks and the final 1-hour stretch, where my body basically forced me to after I exhausted too much energy due to a bizarre situation.

My physical condition wasn’t at its peak either since I'd already done a string of late-night expeditions with others from April 1–4:[ Dundurn Stairs](https://www.reddit.com/r/McMaster/comments/1jowl0t/latenight_visit_to_dundurn_stairs_with_a_group/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button),[ Sam Lawrence Park](https://www.reddit.com/r/McMaster/comments/1jpp7ie/visit_to_sam_lawrence_park_turned_into_a_detoured/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), Cootes Paradise,[ Barton Street](https://www.reddit.com/r/McMaster/comments/1jrg1av/we_walked_down_the_entirety_of_barton_street/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and[ Devil’s Punchbowl](https://www.reddit.com/r/McMaster/comments/1jseksl/walking_from_devils_punchbowl_to_mac_a_night_full/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). My Converse's padding has wore down so bad that I could constantly feel my feet sinking. I packed a small bag that carried 3 water bottles (2 plastic and 1 reusable), 4 protein bars, 3 Kit Kats, a pouch of chargers, 2 power banks, IDs, toothbrush/paste, t-shirt, and some supplies. I packed accordingly so that I genuinely wouldn't need to spend a penny or stop elsewhere for any particular reason.

I had my first exam that ended at 10PM the day before, so I had dinner pretty late and made sure to get my hours in. Sunday was a warm and sunny day, around 15°C, which are two conditions I don't quite enjoy. Yet there I was, ready to begin, on an empty stomach, wearing all black, a jacket, and cargo pants. I basically walked and texted for the first 4 hours. Then my battery started draining due to full brightness against the sun. Just as I was about to charge 5 hours in, my power bank failed me and I panicked. The power bank u/usedPOS graciously lent me a few days prior for the sake of this journey came in clutch. Thank you to u/Candid_Vast9388 and u/usedPOS for providing some oddly specific pics (may or may not have been feet and ass pics, respectively) as morale.

Early on, I had to pause briefly to figure out how to deal with the highway crossings, but in total, I only took 2–3 legitimate breaks near the very end. I had my first sip of water 5 hours in. My first protein bar at 6 hours and first Kit Kat at 8 hours. My first and last washroom stop was 12 hours in at an A&W in Toronto. And my first official break was less than 1 hour away from the destination. 

I shared my location with my friends, u/Candid_Vast9388 and u/Vegetable-Anybody112, who were impressed and commented that I was initially blazing through it all. I was averaging 10km in \~2 hours. I hit 40km in \~8.5 hours of non-stop walking, holding a steady pace of 4-5.50km/h. But after the 9-hour mark, the crash began to creep in ever so slightly. From there onward, grass and dirt became my best friends whenever I could locate any. Touching grass had never felt more euphoric. I reached the ""Welcome to Toronto"" sign in 11.5 hours. My time in Toronto and the final hour to UTSG, though, were absolute hell, especially since I couldn't locate any patches of grass or dirt and stubbornly limped across the sidewalk. Needless to say, this truly pushed my limits, and I went through a turbulent emotional roller coaster ride.","['repetitive', 'comment', 'calorie']",,-0.128,repetitive comment calorie

I am a current UBC student that has worked at Dyne, a UBC-based startup (associated with UBC hatch, UBC-Startups, etc.) as an intern.

I got to first know about the company at the UBC CSSS Tech Career Fair this January through Devvrat Tiwari, who I later learned was a member of the club. I thought that was strange at first but didn’t really think much of it at the time. He made it sound like it was a wonderful place to work and they were offering paid internships. I was really excited about the company and the opportunity as I had no experience. 

As everyone knows, the job market is terrible and I had a difficult time getting interviews for a summer job. So I applied to a lot of the companies present during the career fair and Dyne was one of them. The job posting on the website said it was a volunteer position, which I was surprised to hear due to how they explained it to me at the TCF. I thought it was a mistake but applied anyways, and after getting the offer, I was told that it was indeed a non-paid internship. At that point, I had sunken too much time on it and reluctantly accepted the position because I was unable to get anything else. I managed to find an archive of the posting here: (https://web.archive.org/web/20230206200846/https://www.dyneapp.ca/careers/students)

Something to note, interns would get points based on their performance and if someone was the top performer, they would ""win"" a chance to be a paid intern. It was this weird sort of hunger game moment where we all had to fight against each other to see who was the best at doing unpaid labour.

I didn't think too much of it at first, as I thought any work experience would help me move forward in my career and something was better than nothing. After talking with friends and family regarding my position, I learned that unpaid internships are illegal in British Columbia. I do know there are more interns who continue to get hired and work there for free. I am unsure what to do, but I know that other students shouldn’t be exploited like I was. I need help and I don’t know what to do honestly. It was scary even just to write this in the first place granted the consequences it might have on me because of the NDA they’ve made us sign.

I feel students are being taken advantage of including myself, and I was wondering what we can do to hold the company accountable. I thought that this was a legitimate and trustworthy company as it was at a UBC-sponsored event. I think career fairs imply that the companies present have jobs, not unpaid labour positions. Why did UBC CSSS, the school, and the CS department allow this? I want to report this to help prevent this from happening again, but I’m not sure who to reach out to at the school and if there’s any action we can take against them.

It’s just disappointing seeing companies like this be fully supported by the school to continue to take advantage of students in these trying times.

I’m sorry if this was long-winded but thank you for reading and your help in advance.","['nda', 'arent', 'paying', 'worth', 'much', 'used', 'toilet', 'paper', 'treating', 'initially', 'get', 'worse', 'month', 'keep', 'applying', 'job', 'using', 'experience', 'mass', 'email', 'resume', 'etc', 'linkedin', 'process', 'watch', 'youtube', 'video', 'kill', 'job', 'interview']",,-0.8579,nda arent paying worth much used toilet paper treating initially get worse month keep applying job using experience mass email resume etc linkedin process watch youtube video kill job interview

Another decent proportion are accounts who from their post history are confirmed to have no link to UBC, either living in other cities, or attending other schools. And then a few seem to be genuine UBC folks.

Posting this because it is a pretty common tactic of astroturfing, to brigade subs to create an appearance of consensus where it doesn’t exist, and it is a tactic that is pretty demonstrably done by the very group that the protests are against—from at least 2013 Israel was spending hundreds of millions on spreading anti-Palestinian content on social media (https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-23695896.amp), and they specifically were found by New York Times to have paid for more than 2000 fake accounts spamming comments criticizing pro-Palestinian protesters on facebook alone (https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/05/israel-targeted-lawmakers-in-disinformation-campaign-00161906)

The purpose of these fake accounts is to create the illusion of consensus, and drown out other perspectives. Not saying every post critical of the protesters is not genuine, but if they have a brand new account or one that is clearly not local or with zero connection to UBC that is a pretty big tip-off. 

And lest we forget, our own campus Hillel (pro-Israel advocacy group) was caught putting up pro-Hamas posters (https://ca.news.yahoo.com/ubc-student-group-sjc-stickers-142241426.html) while trying to frame student protesters, leading to student protesters getting death threats and doxxed, so this campus has clearly been a target of ish like this 

(Edit to add: a few commenters have claimed that Hillel had “nothing to do with the pro-Hamas posters and it was just an independent contractor” . Apparently this “independent contractor who worked part time” that Hillel initially refused to name, was identified in the lawsuit as Adam Dobrer, literally the former president of UBC Israel on Campus and a senior Hillel staff member who represented Hillel at AMS meetings as Hillel’s *lead advocacy staff member* (https://ubyssey.ca/news/social-justice-centre-removed-as-plaintiff-in-defamation-lawsuit/) (https://www.ams.ubc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/317-23-Executive-Committee-Minutes-feb1-2023.pdf) )

102952,after paying my rent i will have less than in pocket what a frosh,frosh needs to go,2023-08-29 21:43:10,McGill,,"Worked as o staff in arts frosh this year... and honestly horrified.

Food: 

Ticket prices were over $200 and froshies were only given food at some events. Where they were, the portions were small (especially before or after a day of drinking) and they weren't told they could take seconds. Froshies were not told when they would be given food and what the food was. Also, the gluten free and dairy free options felt like an afterthought. For brunch one day, the gluten free options provided was one orange and a tiny pack of chocolate covered cranberries, while everyone else had bagels with cream cheese. The coords didn't seem to know if the non-meat options were vegan/ dairy free. The options were not clearly marked and it seemed like they were guessing.

Transportation: 

Transportation was not free and most of the events were pretty far away. A $200 ticket should come with a week long metro pass. Drivesafe was advertised as a reliable option, but when it didn't work, coords told staff and froshies to avoid drive safe as they were severely uinderstaffed. There was a significant 'not my problem' attitude when it came to transportation. A lot of froshies are kids who don't know the city and aren't used to public transportation, it's not fair to expect them to know what transportation options work or don't. 

Alcohol: 

Frosh is notorious for being a rowdy event where alcohol is served but it should not be labeled an orientation. It is basically a drinking week. There were no campus tours or events close to campus. There was a movie night in which arts students were told to go to McMed (a science building, not even an arts building.) These kids aren't even familiar with the campus yet but they're going into a week of drinking 3 days before classes start. Any event with alcohol becomes about alcohol at frosh. There were chugging games (organized by the coords) when during training we were told to NEVER encourage chugging. The whole week revolved around alcohol, not seeing campus or the city, or making friends. There was little opportunity for people to talk because most events were at loud clubs.

Accessibility and Inclusivity: 

There was little accommodation for froshies that don't drink. If frosh is a drinking week, it should be advertised as such. People showed up regretting spending so much on a ticket just to watch people drink till they're drunk. There should have been two events at the same time, one with alcohol and one without as not everyone wants to be in that environment. It should not be assumed that everyone is going to drink, therefore nonalcoholic options should be available and advertised. At the bar crawl, people were given 10 minutes to play one chugging drinking game with either water or beer and then made to move to the next bar. 

Golden Rule: 

The golden rule for frosh is that you can't have a sexual or intimate relationship with a froshie as a member of staff. However, one of the events was 'tarps off' (shirtless) which immediately created a sexual environment. All leader-froshie interactions were now in the grey area of the golden rule. Dancing together clothed in a club vs shirtless at an outdoor concert has very different implications.

77616,its so starbucks can pay the employees minimum but still retain them since they can top up the income with tips theyd lose employees if they stopped the tips,"Why We, as UBC Students, Should Rethink the Tipping Culture on Campus",2024-01-31 23:20:59,UBC,Discussion," 

Hey fellow UBC students,

I'm here to open a discussion about a practice we've all become accustomed to: tipping at restaurants, especially the ones on our campus. I believe it's time we seriously reconsider this tipping culture, and here's why:

1. **Not Our Responsibility**: Firstly, it’s not our job as customers to worry about the finances of restaurant workers. This is a matter that should be strictly between the worker and their employer. Our role is to pay for the service and food provided, not to ensure the financial well-being of the employees.
2. **Arbitrary System**: The percentage-based tipping system is inherently arbitrary. For instance, why should a $10 tip be standard for a $50 bill but a $20 tip for a $100 bill? The effort put in by the worker doesn’t necessarily increase proportionally with the bill total.
3. **Bias and Inequality**: There's evidence suggesting that tipping can promote racism and sexism. Studies have shown that [black and minority workers often receive less in tips compared to their white counterparts](https://ecommons.cornell.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/8b1667d9-5040-4e46-aa80-2b949c8c37f4/content). Similarly, [attractive women tend to receive more tips](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/EDI-04-2019-0127/full/html). This is an unfair system that fosters discrimination.
4. **Why Just Waiters?**: Many other jobs, some more challenging than waiting tables, do not receive tips. It's unclear why waiting staff should be an exception. Additionally, the argument that waiters make less than minimum wage and rely on tips is misleading. Legally, employers are required to pay the waiters above the minimum wage threshold.

In conclusion, I strongly urge all of us at UBC to take a stand against the ingrained tipping culture. It's high time that we recognize that the financial responsibility of employees lies with the employers, not the customers. We should advocate for fair and just compensation practices directly from the employers. By collectively choosing not to tip, we send a powerful message that supports a more equitable and transparent system of compensation. Let's be the change and encourage our campus restaurants to adopt fair wage policies, ensuring that their employees are adequately and fairly compensated without relying on the unpredictable and often biased system of tipping.

10102,i understand that it takes more effort but cheating is cheating you can choose not to cheat at any point its essentially just a matter of money,"DO NOT CHEAT, ESPECIALLY WITH SPY TECH, AT YOUR EXAMS",2025-03-27 03:48:52,UofT,Rant,"In UofT Tribunal's most recently-published [Academic Offence case #1695](https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/system/files/university-tribunal-decisions/Case%201695.pdf), the panel states:

>This Tribunal has seen an alarming increase in spyware cases. This is some of the most egregious forms of cheating. It involves premeditation not only to hire the exam service, but to procure and wear the technology. It is pervasive and coordinated. This misconduct must be addressed, and the sanction must be serious to properly reflect the serious nature of the misconduct and to appropriately deter others. **In this case, but for the agreed statement of facts and joint submission on penalty, this Panel would have likely recommended expulsion**.

UofT has published a wave of academic offences, with most appearing to come from a specific demographic based on the names being blurred. This is not to imply a stereotype, but the amount of cases I read on the Tribunal website puts a very bad picture on this demographic of students as UofT's efforts to mitigate cheating are not coming through to them.

Here is a list of **published** AO cases concerning this type of cheating:

\- **NEW:** [Case #1739](https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/system/files/university-tribunal-decisions/Case%201739.pdf): UTM student in their (supposedly) graduating semester was wired with spy tech including ear pieces for an ECON exam. Suspended for 5 years.

\- [Case #1695](https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/system/files/university-tribunal-decisions/Case%201695.pdf): UTSC student used a hidden ear piece and a hidden camera from a button on his clothes, as well as paid for a tutoring service to help him on his Linguistics exam in Summer 2024. Suspended for 5 years.

\- [Case #1653](https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/system/files/university-tribunal-decisions/Case%201653.pdf): UTSC student used a hidden ear piece at an exam in Winter 2024. Paid $1000 for cheating services and was part of a group chat. Suspended for 5 years.

\- [Case #1651](https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/system/files/university-tribunal-decisions/Case%201651%20%281%29.pdf): UTSC student used a hidden ear piece and hidden camera from a button on her clothes. Recommended for expulsion.

\- [Case #1598](https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/system/files/university-tribunal-decisions/Case%201598.pdf): UTSG student used hidden ear piece and hidden camera, as well as paid a tutoring company for an ECO term test in Fall 2023.  Recommended for expulsion.

(for someone with social anxiety, scared of being judged this was huge for me) & this semester was the first one at mcgill where all my profs knew my name and who i was. its led to better grades, better relationships, learning more about the city and going out. so when my profs yesterday and today said ""thank you for a great semester. it's been a pleasure. have a great summer"" i felt sadness - because it was over. it's crazy to believe that i'll be in my last year in the fall. but, i'm so excited for the new memories and experiences i'm sure to have. 

&#x200B;

so to go back to my point of why i decided on mcgill. well, it's been hell. it's had more downs than ups. but i know for a fact that i will graduate a better person, that is more secure and more confident than i came coming in & for that i'm extremely grateful.

&#x200B;

for anyone who is struggling to feel that they belong at this school - it is never too late. :)

16785,report it and then send it to a news outlet,These cheaters are fucking crazy (translation of pic is at the end of this post),2024-09-27 04:09:32,UofT,Other,"So here’s some background information: I am a first year student, taking mat137. On the first day there were people standing outside of the classroom asking us to join a WeChat group chat that’s consisted of students. I was like ok that sounds good maybe I can ask general questions there so I joined. The next morning I woke up and found several people adding me and told me they’re my classmates and would like to make friends with me, again I think it’s fine even though I don’t socialize so I just said yes and left them there in my contact list. 

We never talked, and then recently, to be more specific this week, at different times, they all sent me the exact same message asking me if I need help in homework/quiz/exam. At first I just blocked them all but tonight after receiving this message for the fifth time I got annoyed and asked them what it is. They told me that they can do hw/quiz/exam for me as long as I pay them, and I can even customize the grade. I asked them why aren’t they afraid of getting caught and they told me that there are colluded teacher in uoft and that they have professional team to deal with these problems. That’s insane, I don’t know if that’s true but the fact that they said it and send those messages to a random person like me is crazy. 

I literally just got back home from school after spending 13 hours at school continuously studying my ass off and this happened. These cheaters make me mad asf

Here’s the translation of the message: 

- hii babe need help with homework/quiz/exam?The recent price is very nice! You can also guarantee high score to! Let yourself be the best one! Free consultation. Feel free to contact me at any time to arrange.

What’s this? Pay you to do exam?

- yep you can think so

Didn’t you say you’re a student?

- I am, but I’m also doing international study service

Aren’t you afraid of getting caught and being kicked out?

- Nope they won’t find out. I won’t be doing this if they could. 

Why? Nobody reported you?

- Because we have a professional team here. Plus, as long as you’re not telling this to others no one will know. 

So you’re saying even if you get reported, you can still get rid of that?

- That will count as a complaint. It surely can be dealt. After all, there are professional staff doing this as well.

You mean staff inside U of T?

- Our professional team contact teachers in the school to resolve complaints. Which means directly to the teachers at this school.

So you’re saying that there are teachers colluded?

- you can understand so

From which department? The one that specifically deal with ao?

- Yep

As we enter the final weeks of an extraordinary academic year, questions have naturally been raised about plans for 2021-2022.  We write to confirm that McGill will return to in-person teaching beginning in Fall 2021. While some components of courses will harness the pedagogical benefits of online teaching, students and teaching staff should plan for a return to more regular rhythms of on-campus academic activity by September. With this in mind, student residences will be open in Fall 2021 with the usual guarantee of accommodation to all eligible first-year students who request it. We will likewise continue to develop plans for a progressive return to on-campus work for administrative and support staff, with the goal of achieving a regular presence by September 2021.
 
The health and wellbeing of our community will of course remain a top priority, and all necessary health and safety measures will continue to be implemented to ensure that our campuses remain safe places to learn and to work in the coming year. While the evolution of the public health situation in Quebec cannot be known with certainty, we are confident in our collective capacity to deliver academic programs and university services in a way that meets the standards of excellence expected of McGill University while continuing to ensure the safety of our community.

69773,youre entitled to speech but not to a platform and not to the respect of your audience if i dont like what youre saying its my free speech to express that,I'm afraid to speak my mind at UBC,2020-08-04 17:09:12,UBC,Discussion,"Hi all, I'm writing to express my perspective as a UBC faculty member on talking about politically charged ideas on campus. UBC's values emphasize equity and inclusion, which I fully support. I would like to engage, and be part of this effort, but I’m afraid to. This is **not** a far-right post purporting to support free speech but actually advocating for bigotry - I don't identify with those perspectives at all and I believe they are very harmful. Rather, I consider myself fairly liberal, but I get the impression that I'm not always ""liberal enough"" to freely express my views at UBC and that, if I do, my career might be negatively impacted. (I’m posting this with some trepidation and am grateful for the anonymity.) This post, then, is about my worry that the university's approach to these issues might be backfiring: by being too forceful, we are shutting down debates and making many potential allies feel alienated and unsafe about expressing their views. And we really need these allies on board championing equity and inclusion.

As a concrete example, I've been thinking a lot about the [recent events surrounding UBC's board chair](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/michael-korenberg-resigns-ubc-1.5621268). (Note: I don't have any extra information here beyond what I've seen in the news.) My impression is that this person was not a good fit for the job and UBC is better off finding someone whose values are better aligned with the university's values. Truly, I can't understand why someone in that position would show up to a meeting wearing a MAGA hat or go around liking those tweets - both because I can't understand supporting those causes and because it seems obvious that these actions would be inflammatory. However, I'm not sure it was appropriate to completely throw this person under the bus; to me at least, it sends a message (true or not) that conservative views are not tolerated at UBC and one's tenure at UBC may not outlive one's expression of these views. And I am being literal here - I am a bit troubled and actually *not sure* how to handle such situations - that is not a euphemism for disagreement. In my state of being unsure, some discussion would be great. Unfortunately, I’m worried that expressing any view other than ""good riddance!""  might lead to trouble for me. I have heard several stories about folks being shamed or intensely criticized for expressing the ""wrong"" views. (Am I exaggerating about this trouble? I am basing these worries on my own observations, but still, maybe this is all in my head, or maybe I’m particularly sensitive or risk-averse. So I should add a reminder that all this is just one person’s perspective.) 

A problem with keeping quiet is that, across a broad range of issues, my inner mental state and what I would need to say in public are drifting apart. From talking to others, I think this is very common at UBC. Here is what I've observed: outwardly, most people follow the party line, and so it looks like we're doing well at promoting equity and inclusion. But in reality, from what I can gather based on private conversations, peoples' inner thoughts vary widely. I've heard about extreme cases where people post something on social media and then, in private, say the exact opposite. In the short term, this system works: things are getting better because some bad behaviour is genuinely being eliminated. But I don't think this is going to work long term if we're fostering a fear-fuelled theatre of tolerance rather than actual tolerance. This really worries me.

Part of the reason I feel unsafe engaging in these issues is that it's not at all clear to me what is OK and what is not OK at UBC. Some things are obvious: bigotry is not tolerated and should not be tolerated. But some things are very muddy and nuanced. For example, it seems that supporting the current U.S. administration is not permitted (see above) and that criticizing the current U.S. administration is fine. However, criticizing some other countries' governments is actually not OK (I have been told), because it can lead to folks (e.g. international students) from those countries feeling unwelcome and can fan the flames of xenophobia. Perhaps there are some other governments beyond the U.S. that we can openly criticize - I don't know. It feels like there's a set of unwritten rules of what is/isn’t ""allowed"" at UBC, but nobody has told me the rules. And if these rules are hard for me, as someone who has been around here for a while, I can only imagine what it would be like for the new folks joining UBC each year, especially from other countries or cultures. It feels like we're inviting people into a minefield of these unwritten rules - sort of like inviting someone to a dinner party without telling them about the dress code. My goal here is not to criticize these rules; in fact, many of them make sense to me. But rather, my concern is that the rules are really complicated and haven't been clearly communicated - and that the consequences for violating the rules can sometimes be serious. This is a bad combination that stokes my fear of engaging in conversation. 

From my standpoint as a faculty member, I have some thoughts on how we might improve the situation. I suggest trying to bridge the gap between different views, by engaging each other in conversation rather than shutting people down or shaming them. When we hear true intolerance, we need to stop it in its tracks. When we hear questions about process, or why things are a certain way, or genuine struggles with inclusion -- in other words good faith discussion and engagement -- a safety net is needed; this type of engagement should not put one's reputation at risk. 

I think this messaging needs to come from the top. Even one message from a high-up UBC authority could make me feel a lot more safe and accepted. Something along the lines of, ""We expect everyone at UBC to act according to our UBC Code of Conduct [or equivalent document], and this is non-negotiable. This won't be easy for everyone, and that's OK. We understand that different members of the UBC community will have different perspectives, and we welcome discussion on these difficult issues. We don't have all the answers and we, the UBC leadership, may benefit from talking to you as much as you would benefit from talking to us."" The idea here is to combine clarity (link to Code of Conduct), firmness (it's non-negotiable), understanding (this won't be easy for everyone, and that's OK), and some humility (we're doing our best, but we don't have all the answers). 

I think UBC's Equity & Inclusion Office also plays an important role here. In my limited interactions with this office, it is staffed by extremely professional, competent, liberal individuals. What about finding some conservative-leaning staff or running some workshops about the struggles to embrace UBC's worldview for folks coming from very different perspectives? To me at least that would be so powerful, and very inclusive; it would show that conservative folks aren't by default considered bad people, and that even if some of their values don't align with UBC's values, we still want to talk to them. Second, in the various equity and inclusion workshops and training sessions offered for faculty, I would add in the opportunity to challenge the prevailing views. From what I've seen, these workshops are often framed as showing us the ""correct"" way to act and to be. I don't think that works. There are a lot of really sensitive issues at play here - for example, should we consider a person's gender or race when hiring faculty or admitting students - and if so, how? I think these issues are too difficult to be solved without discussion. 

Once again, I am not trying to argue for ""anything goes"" free speech or downsizing our efforts toward a more equitable and inclusive campus. Rather, I'm arguing for realigning our efforts on this front to engage people more genuinely. If I can't express my doubts, nobody will know to address them, and they will linger or fester. I suspect there's a large untapped resource of people at UBC who, like me, want to do more but are disengaging out of fear, frustration, or disillusionment. I would love to open myself up as an ally for UBC's values without fear of a misstep.

-----

**Update**: thank you for all the discussion. I learned a lot from reading the responses and reflecting. This was more or less my first time engaging in a discussion like this outside of private conversations. 

I did not realize students were aware of Michael Korenberg and his views while he was in office, though this seems obvious in hindsight. I hadn't heard of him until he resigned and I saw the news, which likely made it more jarring for me. I feel more at ease about this now. As mentioned in one of my replies below, I would still advocate for some accompanying wording about how career repercussions for political views are reserved for extreme cases (and I'm on board with this being a legitimate extreme case). It's hard to know how much to generalize from myself to others, but I suspect such a sentiment might put a lot of people at ease.

Another follow-up thought is that it seems like one's personal and professional personas are increasingly merged. For example, I know many academics for whom Twitter is a crucial tool to their career development. I don't know any academics who have separate personal and professional social media identities though. And even if they did, people at work could find their personal accounts. I think this complicates matters, because the realms of public and private are increasingly blurred. I don't have any suggestions for what to do about it.

Thanks for the references to the [paradox of tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance). I had heard of it but not engaged with it as much in the past as now. I support being intolerant of intolerance. My lingering concern is that it's very hard to know where the line is, beyond which something is considered intolerance at UBC. As discussed in my post, sometimes it's obvious (e.g. some of the views Korenberg liked on Twitter) but sometimes I feel it's quite tricky. From what I can gather, the boundary depends not just on the message, but also the medium, the context, the person’s role, and probably more. For example, what if the UBC Board Chair had a sign on their front lawn supporting a Conservative candidate before an election? What about a faculty member expressing doubt, at a faculty meeting, about whether certain pro-inclusion practices are effective? It seems like those should be OK, right? It's all very tricky.

Finally, my post focussed mostly on feeling afraid and unsafe, but I should admit to feeling some frustration as well. Personally, I feel I've grown a lot from being at UBC - first learning about equity and inclusion issues, and more recently trying to stand up for equity and inclusion when opportunities arise. But I still don't fully feel a sense of belonging at UBC. When I have doubts about these types of issues, I feel my concerns are unwelcome. Hard to say if this is caused by my own issues vs. the culture at UBC, though. In any case, this conversation has diminished my frustration somewhat, so thanks again.","['youre', 'entitled', 'speech', 'platform', 'respect', 'audience', 'dont', 'like', 'youre', 'saying', 'free', 'speech', 'express']",,0.001,youre entitled speech platform respect audience dont like youre saying free speech express

Hi. I'm sorry to be writing today, I'm really distressed and panicking.

At around 12:10PM on the way to Olympic Village station, I (19F asian girl wearing glasses) was assaulted by an elderly caucasian man (60-70s) holding a striped cane today on the Canada Line. I was sitting on a seat in the front section of the train nearest to the door next to the aisle and listening to music with my noise-cancelling headphones. At around Broadway station the man got on the train, came up to me, and hit me with his cane and demanded I get up from my seat, yelling “GET UP!”. I always make sure to give my seat to the elderly and pregnant, but in this case I refused to reward the man’s behaviour for bullying me and hitting me, and since the seat I was sitting in was not an elderly-priority seat.

I was angry and wanted to stand up for the future victims, wondering how many times this man got away with this. So instead of getting up from my seat I told him ""No, this seat is not elderly seating, I'm not obligated to give my seat to you"", but he hit me harder again with his cane. He yelled at me and kept repeating “get up right now”, hitting me again as I kept saying no. Then he started elbowing me hard in the ribs and I could try to tell he was trying his hardest to hurt me.

Then a big middle-aged Caucasian man holding a beer got up. I first thought he was going to stand up for me, but instead, he yelled at me for not giving up my seat saying it was disrespectful. I could tell he was probably drunk and he was carrying a beer. Then, the young South Asian guy sitting next to me defended me and agreed that I'm not obligated to give up my seat. However, another middle-aged Caucasian woman joined in, defending the elderly man. The drunk man kept yelling at me and got closer yelling that he “witnessed it” when I said I was going to call the police.

I was afraid I was going to get punched or injured since he was drunk so I got out of the train trying to de-escalate the situation, but I’m infuriated at myself how I didn’t ask for any witnesses’ contact info, I didn't even check the train number, I froze up and didn't do anything. I think I had my first panic attack. I was so stupid and ignorant and didn’t do anything. Most of all, I’m really upset that no one except the South Asian guy stood up for me and just watched me get hit and let them gang up on me. I feel so helpless and without support. Now I realize I was stupid and should've given up my seat, if i just complied this would've been avoided. I doubt the police can do anything, and I’m afraid to go on transit again.

I beg any witnesses who viewed this incident to come forward. I already reported it to the transit police, but I need witnesses to make this case go through. If you know anyone who took the Canada Line going to Waterfront this morning please please please come forward. Thank you

Had to redo with better title btw :) Also proof I made the post.

So I in fact am a CS student, I never actually kissed a man. I did with a mask on in my highschool CS class though once, but that was for a bereal(if that still exists) photo.

That brings me to why I did this. It was for a bird course project which was worth a lot. Sad to admit but I am really good at karma farming and saying the right things in posts for them to get some traction. Not going to say which but a lot of the old 200+ upvote posts here are my old accounts.

Its common sense that people follow trends, Narrative Transportation Theory, Social Constructionism, the Bandwagon Effect, and more. But I wanted to prove it somewhat for bonus marks.

All it took was a few new accounts to post some outrageous statements that I knew UofT students would love reading, usually something related to memes and in this case CS students, then throw in some details like a GF and make it a ""got me in the first half"" type post or confession. So I posted an open ended text in POV format.

Once that caught traction as expected, I constructed a second POV. The POV was the man who got kissed. That caught traction too. So that was good, but what was even better is that what I planned came true. People on their own started joining in, they made their own POVS and started it own ecosystem that took over this sub for a few days.

Hopefully my prof appreciates the extra work I put in, plus I really need the GPA boost.","['put', 't', 'ur', 'resume', 'bro', 'google', 'calling']",,0.0,put t ur resume bro google calling

####Much of the information below has been adapted from /u/brianthelionn's [previous megathread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/fg29hd/addressing_covid19_and_misinformation) Many thanks for all of their hard work maintaining it!

#Symptoms and treatment of COVID-19

COVID-19 is the respiratory infection caused by the novel (new) coronavirus which originated in December in Wuhan, China. It is part of a [family of viruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus) that includes SARS and MERS.

###The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and fatigue. If you feel sick, call 514-644-4545 for advice. If you have difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.

Other possible symptoms include muscle aches, nasal congestion, a runny nose, a sore throat, or diarrhea. However, some cases are totally asymptomatic, while remaining contagious. Symptoms can develop up to 14 days from the date of infection, with an average incubation period of 5 to 6 days.

[Information about the testing site at Hôtel-Dieu Hospital is available here.](https://santemontreal.qc.ca/en/public/coronavirus-covid-19/#c37517)

Around 80% of cases are considered mild, and can generally be treated at home by resting, staying hydrated, and taking medication to reduce fever as needed. However, more severe cases may require hospitalization. If you have difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.

#Steps to take

The virus spreads through tiny droplets that travel through the air when we cough and sneeze. When these land on our hands or other shared surfaces like doorknobs and tables, others can pick up the virus. Accordingly, you should:

* **[Wash your hands regularly with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds.](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/phac-aspc/documents/services/diseases-maladies/reduce-spread-covid-19-wash-your-hands/eng-handwashing.pdf)** Hand sanitizer should only be used in the absence of soap.

* **Cover your coughs and sneezes with your elbow,** and when you use a tissue, immediately dispose of it and wash your hands.

* **Don't touch your face with unwashed hands!** This is the number one way to become infected. Disinfect your phone screen, laptop keyboard, and any other surfaces you frequently use.

* **Practice social distancing by remaining at home.** When you do make essential trips outside, stay at least 2 metres (6 feet) away from others.

* **Leave masks for those who need them:** sick or immunocompromised people, and those who spend time around them, such as health workers. A mask provides little protection if you're just walking around outside, and [chances are you wouldn't be wearing it correctly.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/fhp232/megathread_novel_coronavirus_covid19_pandemic_all/fknrtnc)

* **Make contingency plans** with your family, roommates, friends, and/or neighbours, such as to go shopping for one another if someone is required to quarantine.

#How serious is this?

This is a serious situation and **significantly worse than the seasonal flu.** The virus's overall mortality rate is unknown because many cases are not tested and confirmed, but it the WHO estimates it to be about 2.5–3.5%. This rate also increases if the healthcare system becomes so overwhelmed that some cases cannot be treated.

In general, the global situation has become more severe over the past month. Again, the world is not coming to an end, but it's important to pay attention to the situation and follow the guidelines in place. We've seen what has been happening in countries that were highly proactive (like South Korea) vs. countries that were less so (like the United States).

**Just because you may be young and healthy, you aren't in the clear.** While most deaths have been among older people and those with existing health problems such as a compromised immune system, some younger people have also become badly ill, and regardless, you do not want to spread the virus to more vulnerable populations.

27295,i personally would have started coughing and getting closer to them just to mess with them and get them to leave me alone sorry that happened to you,I got harassed for wearing a mask today,2020-05-13 05:02:17,UofT,Discussion,"I’ve been a long time lurker and I never thought I’d post anything on reddit but I feel the need to talk about what happened today. 

I was around Yonge/Wellesley area today to do some errands (pick up dog food and grocery shop) and while I was walking home, a Caucasian person decided to follow me along the way and harass me for wearing a mask. (For background, I’m Asian, Korean to be more specific) This person started to talk to me about how masks are useless and why I am wearing them... and then proceeded to call me stupid. This person would berate me, pause, walk a bit forward, then as I walk up to her again, she would start ranting again. I wanted to think that this person would just rant a bit and just go away but this went on for two more blocks. I didn’t want to interact with her so I just ignored her. I also carried a 4kg bag of dog food plus two big bags of groceries so my hands were preoccupied. But as I approached the entrance of my condo, she ran up to me (she was already way ahead waiting for me) and attempted to kick me. Luckily I didn’t get hurt, she kicked my groceries. But at this point, I just yelled “What the fuck is your problem?!” And she just went away. 

I felt really angry when I got home. Called my parents/friends and talked about it. I was angry that she targeted me and tbh, also really disappointed no one attempted to intervene. This didn’t happen in the middle of the night. It happened around 4pm on Yonge street in plain daylight. Other people were wearing masks too, and as this person just harassed me, people just staring at me. Though I don’t blame anyone, I’m sad that everyone just stared at me. I wish I could’ve retaliated but my hands were full and I didn’t want to give my attention to this person so I kept on ignoring her. Which, in retrospect, I kind of regret. 

I felt more angry in the beginning but now I’m feeling a lot more scared/anxious. I feel like it’s scary to go outside now. I walked my dog tonight and I saw a glimpse of someone walking along Yonge st and I freaked out and just ran back inside. Maybe I’m overreacting right now but I’m pretty rattled. 

I’m just really stunned that this happened to me, just for wearing a mask. To me, a mask does not just protects me but protects everyone so I’m also just surprised at the ignorance. I realize many asians are being targeted and that’s really not okay. I understand every one is going through hardships and maybe the person who harassed me had been going through some tough shit. It’s understandable to be frustrated but that should not be a justification to mistreat anyone. 

I just felt like posting this, maybe as a cathartic release because I still feel light-chested. 
My post is pretty long, thanks for anyone who read this and I hope everyone stays safe and healthy.","['personally', 'would', 'started', 'coughing', 'getting', 'closer', 'mess', 'get', 'leave', 'alone', 'sorry', 'happened']",,-0.6124,personally would started coughing getting closer mess get leave alone sorry happened

I am a PhD student at UBC and I get a stipend of around $2000 per month. My rent is $1300 and my monthly groceries are $400. Add to this the health insurance of $75, the phone bill of $50, and the freakin' coin laundry bill of $20. I am a human too so I go out on some weekends and let's add a miscellaneous budget of $100 per month. All of this totals to $1945.

So am I saving $55 a month? Heck no! I need to pay the tuition fee which averages to $500 a month. There you go, I am cashflow negative, let alone saving peanuts.

The point of this post is to get an idea of how other grad students at UBC are staying afloat. If you are a grad student, please share your story here. If you are an undergrad who is willing to pursue a PhD, DO NOT apply to UBC, just apply to universities in the US or EU.

Further updates will come in the following weeks and with monthly updates.

From the Q&A:

* **It is** ***expected*** **that all students be in Montreal this fall**, even international (International students will be able to get vaccinated in Canada, further details to come).
* Large classes like Leacock will be delivered remotely. **For smaller classes** (<150)**, the default is expected to be in-person.** A remote alternative is *not expected* to be available for *all* classes.
* It is expected that ***some*** exams will be in-person, in exam hubs (TBF). There won't be in-person crowded field house exams though.
* A sudden red-alert scenario is also planned, though it is ""*really unlikely"".* The realistic and realistic+ scenarios are the ones being planned for the moment.
* **Reminder**: The realistic scenarios may seem worrisome for some students, especially the ones 'at risk'. However, all students (or anyone in general) *having health conditions putting them at risk* will be vaccinated before September.
* Extracurricular activities like frosh are part of the planning but wasn't the subject of today's town hall. Communications are made with student associations to plan and determine the likelihood of such event to happen: they aren't ignoring these activities but it is not the *main* focus.
* Graduate students: hybrid models are currently being evaluated for PhD defence.

####Much of the information below has been adapted from /u/brianthelionn's [previous megathread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/fg29hd/addressing_covid19_and_misinformation) Many thanks for all of their hard work maintaining it!

#Symptoms and treatment of COVID-19

COVID-19 is the respiratory infection caused by the novel (new) coronavirus which originated in December in Wuhan, China. It is part of a [family of viruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus) that includes SARS and MERS.

###The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and fatigue. If you feel sick, call 514-644-4545 for advice. If you have difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.

Other possible symptoms include muscle aches, nasal congestion, a runny nose, a sore throat, or diarrhea. However, some cases are totally asymptomatic, while remaining contagious. Symptoms can develop up to 14 days from the date of infection, with an average incubation period of 5 to 6 days.

[Information about the testing site at Hôtel-Dieu Hospital is available here.](https://santemontreal.qc.ca/en/public/coronavirus-covid-19/#c37517)

Around 80% of cases are considered mild, and can generally be treated at home by resting, staying hydrated, and taking medication to reduce fever as needed. However, more severe cases may require hospitalization. If you have difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.

#Steps to take

The virus spreads through tiny droplets that travel through the air when we cough and sneeze. When these land on our hands or other shared surfaces like doorknobs and tables, others can pick up the virus. Accordingly, you should:

* **[Wash your hands regularly with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds.](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/phac-aspc/documents/services/diseases-maladies/reduce-spread-covid-19-wash-your-hands/eng-handwashing.pdf)** Hand sanitizer should only be used in the absence of soap.

* **Cover your coughs and sneezes with your elbow,** and when you use a tissue, immediately dispose of it and wash your hands.

* **Don't touch your face with unwashed hands!** This is the number one way to become infected. Disinfect your phone screen, laptop keyboard, and any other surfaces you frequently use.

* **Practice social distancing by remaining at home.** When you do make essential trips outside, stay at least 2 metres (6 feet) away from others.

* **Leave masks for those who need them:** sick or immunocompromised people, and those who spend time around them, such as health workers. A mask provides little protection if you're just walking around outside, and [chances are you wouldn't be wearing it correctly.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/fhp232/megathread_novel_coronavirus_covid19_pandemic_all/fknrtnc)

* **Make contingency plans** with your family, roommates, friends, and/or neighbours, such as to go shopping for one another if someone is required to quarantine.

#How serious is this?

This is a serious situation and **significantly worse than the seasonal flu.** The virus's overall mortality rate is unknown because many cases are not tested and confirmed, but it the WHO estimates it to be about 2.5–3.5%. This rate also increases if the healthcare system becomes so overwhelmed that some cases cannot be treated.

In general, the global situation has become more severe over the past month. Again, the world is not coming to an end, but it's important to pay attention to the situation and follow the guidelines in place. We've seen what has been happening in countries that were highly proactive (like South Korea) vs. countries that were less so (like the United States).

**Just because you may be young and healthy, you aren't in the clear.** While most deaths have been among older people and those with existing health problems such as a compromised immune system, some younger people have also become badly ill, and regardless, you do not want to spread the virus to more vulnerable populations.

As we enter the final weeks of an extraordinary academic year, questions have naturally been raised about plans for 2021-2022.  We write to confirm that McGill will return to in-person teaching beginning in Fall 2021. While some components of courses will harness the pedagogical benefits of online teaching, students and teaching staff should plan for a return to more regular rhythms of on-campus academic activity by September. With this in mind, student residences will be open in Fall 2021 with the usual guarantee of accommodation to all eligible first-year students who request it. We will likewise continue to develop plans for a progressive return to on-campus work for administrative and support staff, with the goal of achieving a regular presence by September 2021.
 
The health and wellbeing of our community will of course remain a top priority, and all necessary health and safety measures will continue to be implemented to ensure that our campuses remain safe places to learn and to work in the coming year. While the evolution of the public health situation in Quebec cannot be known with certainty, we are confident in our collective capacity to deliver academic programs and university services in a way that meets the standards of excellence expected of McGill University while continuing to ensure the safety of our community.
 
We appreciate that you will have questions in the coming weeks and months and we commit to providing regular updates as we prepare for a return to on-campus activity.

I'm an international student from Wuhan China and I'm currently at UTSG (last time visited home was in June 2019/arrived Toronto in September 2019). In my hometown, Wuhan, China, a new type of lung virus is spreading since December 2019 and currently 544 cases confirmed within China and 17 victims had passed away so far. The virus is still actively spreading now and has already been found in the U. S., U. K. and in many other places (6 confirmed cases oversea and many possible causes). I just heard some news that there are two possible cases found in Toronto (north york) and I think its good to let our community know about it. Not my intention to raises any panic. 

The SARS virus in 2003 had caused painful damage to the Toronto area, and since now it is still the early stage of this new lung virus's spreading if all of us can be aware of it and be alert it would be helpful I think. Within my Chinese student group, people are worried and scared and all starting to purchases medical masks. All family and friends are in Wuhan and my city and my country are fighting hard. To be honest, I don't know what I should do or could do now, and I just think it may be helpful to update us with the latest messages, and hope I could gain some power, really need it now. Cheers

\-------------------------------

Btw I just came across a post named 'why international students wear luxury clothes and rich' loll I think the Chinese international student that attract people's attention in the crowd and in the news are people who wear out-standing things or with out-standing appearances. The rest of the international student communities stay invisible (me a very good example no second glance (even first glance loll) would fall on me on the street and same with many of my international student friends)

I pay an international fee and my family works hard, and we sold our apartment. I study hard and I struggle like hell and all my friends do too, regardless of their racial identity, or whether they come from local or other places or not causes yeah we are at UOFT.

International students often face extreme difficulties and we tend to keep problems to ourselves (at least me cause one my English is not perfect, communication for me is energy consuming, and sometime when I don't really understand what people are saying I just nod and smile. Two I'm afraid to reach out and afraid of being rejected. Introvert here hate self-introduction in the first class. I witness so many strugglings on both international students and non-international students and we are in one big community, it is my sincere voices that fewer stereotypes of international students would spread away ...not all of international are spoiled rich kids.

90130,it also morally feels bad to destroy campuses and barricade employees inside a building but hey they did it anyway at least mcgills moral fumble makes them a good amount of money because thats how the world works a lot of money is in weapon manufacturers so investing in them gives lots of profit i also dont know why mcgills being targeted since the amount they provide is likely inconsequential and not worth the effort if people really cared they would boycott the big rich companies that are invested in the same weapons companies like microsoft and apple the starbucks boycott was a good idea but it didnt lead to much because a protest from across the globe can never really do much to help unless the majority of people actually care enough to join,The issue with the protests,2024-10-08 17:34:04,McGill,Political,"Alright folks, feel free to educate me in the comments, but I just gotta get this off my chest. 
I believe there is a deep flaw within the protests, which is leading to them actually harming their cause more than they are benefiting it. 

As a third party student whose activities are being disturbed by the protests, I find it difficult to not side with the corporation that is McGill. As a queer, far-left, ACAB, eat the rich person, it really hurts me to do so, but the protests have given me no choice. 

Now let me explain my thought process; upon hearing about the protests, I was immediately taken aback. I didn’t quite understand the relation between McGill and Palestine. Education and curiosity is power tho, so I made sure to inquire with some of the protestors. The demands of divestment etc. albeit being a little naive imo, make some sense. I can understand that people don’t want an educational institution investing in warfare. Now, with the current McGill situation, such a massive cut would be crippling to the university, and would obviously be turned around and further taken from the staff and TAs, with it having a negligible, if even tangible, change to the overall situation in Palestine. 

Which is where I find my issue. Why do I need to incquire to learn the protest’s motivations and demands. Any third party who isn’t willing to go look into it themselves simply sees signs about freeing Palestine, with no relation to the university. No one is shooting people in the name of McGill, why are the protests even here right? Overall, there should be people with pickets and signs about McGill war profiteering if that’s the target issue.
Take the law prof protests. They’re out there waving their flags and pickets, and at an immediate glance you know 1. Who they are, 2. Who they’re protesting. 3. What they want. Having these as the forefront of your protest is vital if you want to get the people who’s lives you’re interrupting to rally to your cause. But picketing with signs saying free Palestine next to a university who’s only financially linked to a company that financially profiting from a war caused by two other parties, doesn’t really make sense to me. 

Obviously I’m not mentioning other demands such as cutting off Israeli scholars and such, as that is obviously in the interests of the warmongers exclusively. And aside from it being frankly racist and judgemental, serves to limit education and progress. Only someone looking to seed hate would ask for the segregation of a people within education.

Anyway, that’s my piece on it. The protests, although there is a spark of positive in their heart, has only caused harm to the cause, and the community due to the poor marketability and picketing of its members. 

Tl:DR:
If I have to ask protesters who they are, what their demands are, and how the cause is even relevant to where they’re causing disturbances, then you’re protesting wrong, sorry :/ This info should all be gleened from a glance at the protest. Not having this readily available simply pushes far-left people like me, the target audience, who would’ve supported the cause, against it.

I am a PhD student at UBC and I get a stipend of around $2000 per month. My rent is $1300 and my monthly groceries are $400. Add to this the health insurance of $75, the phone bill of $50, and the freakin' coin laundry bill of $20. I am a human too so I go out on some weekends and let's add a miscellaneous budget of $100 per month. All of this totals to $1945.

So am I saving $55 a month? Heck no! I need to pay the tuition fee which averages to $500 a month. There you go, I am cashflow negative, let alone saving peanuts.

The point of this post is to get an idea of how other grad students at UBC are staying afloat. If you are a grad student, please share your story here. If you are an undergrad who is willing to pursue a PhD, DO NOT apply to UBC, just apply to universities in the US or EU.

Hello future McGillians! We know that you have lots of questions, and we're here to help answer them. To keep the subreddit orderly, all that we ask is that you restrict discussion to this megathread. All other posts will be removed.

Before you comment, please **read the FAQs below**, and note that administrative inquires about requirements, deadlines, financial aid, etc. are best directed to [Service Point](https://www.mcgill.ca/servicepoint).

You might also try asking your question [here](http://ask.mcgill.ca/) on the McGill website.

**What are my chances of getting in? When will I receive a decision?**

We aren't admissions officers, so we can't tell you anything beyond the general rule that offers are made in waves, based on grades and test scores, until all available spaces are filled. This means that the higher you are above the [minimum requirements](https://www.mcgill.ca/applying/requirements) for your program, the better your odds of acceptance, and the [sooner you're likely to hear back](https://www.mcgill.ca/applying/nextsteps/decision).

However, simply being above the minimum requirements is not a guarantee of admission.

**If I don't meet the requirements for the program I want, can I get into another program and then transfer?**

Transferring into most programs is a lot harder than getting admitted to them in the first place, so while this is a possible route to take, it's a big risk as you would have to substantially improve your academic performance in your first year.

**What if I'm accepted with my predicted grades or scores, but then they go down a little?**

As long as you pass all of your classes and graduate from your current high school or CEGEP, you'll be fine.

**Is McGill better than this other university? Is a McGill degree good for jobs?**

Most of us haven't attended any other universities or been in the labour market for very long, so we probably can't give you an informed opinion.

**How hard is it to get a high GPA at McGill? I've heard there's grade deflation.**

It's hard—McGill will not hold your hand—but it's also perfectly possible to graduate with a high GPA if you take courses that interest you and manage your time efficiently. In other words, your perception of difficulty will vary based on your program and your academic background, such as how good the study skills you developed in high school are.

Different faculties and departments have different policies when it comes to forcibly curving a class's grades down so that there's a certain average (also known as ""grade deflation"").

**What is student life like?**

Lots and lots has already been said about this topic. [Read through some past threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/search?q=student+life+-flair%3ASSMU&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) to get some ideas.

Broadly speaking, being in the midst of a city as fun and affordable as Montreal, socializing tends to happen off-campus. There is a visible party culture, so if that's up your alley you will probably find it easier to make friends. However, with 27,000 undergraduates and hundreds of clubs, there is a niche for everyone. You may just have to look a little harder to find yours.

Of course, a big part of life in Montreal is dealing with winter. Seasonal depression is real, so consider your ability to tolerate five months of overcast days with 4 pm sunsets, freezing temperatures (sometimes as low as -30° C with wind chill), and occasional icy sidewalks that make getting to class downright hazardous.

**Do I need to speak French to come to McGill?**

No. Montreal is a relatively bilingual city, so you can spend four years here and get by without a word of French. However, your life will be much easier and more opportunities will be available to you if you can speak—or make an effort to learn—un peu de français.

31240,this is actually awful what the fuck i get it rules matter but obviously you didnt do it on purpose and as long as youre writing the right exam whats it to anyone if you wrote in a different room just this once im so sorry this happened to you,My lovely stats exam,2019-12-19 21:13:05,UofT,Discussion,"So I had a stats exam yesterday and essentially, ACORN gave me the wrong location. 

It was weird however since everything was going fine and dandy while I was writing the exam until two hours had passed. Right when they announced there was an hour left, the prof came up to me and told me to stop writing.

I asked him why and he then only told me I was in the wrong exam room. TWO HOURS AFTER. I asked him what I could do and he said I should run to the other exam location (btw it was 20 min away). I told him if I did that, I would have less than an hour to complete a three-hour exam and I would fail (the final was worth 60% of my grade). 

I begged him for me to just let me complete this exam and then he just pulled me aside and yelled at me.  I felt so hopeless. They weren’t even trying to help me out. I kept asking what I could do and they were essentially saying “take the 0.”

Now I had to defer my exam but it’s just so messed up. Instead of helping me or instead of figuring out that I was in the wrong location after they came around for signatures in the beginning of the exam, they left me in the dust.

I know uni is supposed to be about us growing into adults and blah blah blah, but profs should be there to help students, not penalize them.

UPDATE: Thank you guys for your overwhelming support, it means a lot! I wasn't going to write this post initially because I thought somehow I was in the wrong and everyone would think I'm the boy crying wolf. But now, I know that feeling indignant is valid. Thanks for the advice and opinions, I am going to the board about this. I think UofT needs to learn how to properly take care of the students (and not in just this particular situation, also mental health), and I hope that this story has brought light onto their insensitivity and injustice.","['actually', 'awful', 'fuck', 'get', 'rule', 'matter', 'obviously', 'didnt', 'purpose', 'long', 'youre', 'writing', 'right', 'exam', 'whats', 'anyone', 'wrote', 'different', 'room', 'im', 'sorry', 'happened']",,-0.6499,actually awful fuck get rule matter obviously didnt purpose long youre writing right exam whats anyone wrote different room im sorry happened

I am a PhD student at UBC and I get a stipend of around $2000 per month. My rent is $1300 and my monthly groceries are $400. Add to this the health insurance of $75, the phone bill of $50, and the freakin' coin laundry bill of $20. I am a human too so I go out on some weekends and let's add a miscellaneous budget of $100 per month. All of this totals to $1945.

So am I saving $55 a month? Heck no! I need to pay the tuition fee which averages to $500 a month. There you go, I am cashflow negative, let alone saving peanuts.

The point of this post is to get an idea of how other grad students at UBC are staying afloat. If you are a grad student, please share your story here. If you are an undergrad who is willing to pursue a PhD, DO NOT apply to UBC, just apply to universities in the US or EU.

I suggest that these teams are removed from Orchard Commons as they pose a dangerous threat to the rest of us, students. Coaches should remove these students from all practices and games (if they are happening) because they now threaten infecting other athletes.

22389,i am genuinely curious as what you think you have on your side of the bargaining table against the biggest employers of your field there is a glut of pharmacists who are willing to undercut each other just to have any sort of a job,"To anyone (still) considering pharmacy at UofT, or pharmacy as a profession, please read",2020-10-22 04:59:42,UofT,Discussion,"Hi everyone,

Some of you may have come across my post a few months back ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/h0hvrn/honest_review_of_uoft_pharmd_program/)) about the pharmacy program at UofT/industry trends in Canada. Despite my less than cheery outlook then, the situation has rapidly deteriorated even more, and I wanted to give you a front-seat view on what is happening with our profession. I have attached screenshots from the pharmacy group at UofT (c/o 2020), names blurred to respect my colleagues' privacy.

Nobody is willing to speak up, for fear of ""burning bridges in the field"" (which is utter nonsense by the way, because the regulatory bodies/faculty clearly doesn't give a sh\*t about us). I recognize there isn't much that can be done, but at the very least, I can show you the real side of pharmacy in Canada right now.

**Our own regulatory body thinks we aren't needed enough to be licensed, so recent grads are working for minimum wage in high-risk environments.**

For those of you who are unfamiliar, in order to practice as a pharmacist, not only do you need to graduate from the pharmacy program, you also need to write a board exam (PEBC). This is consistent with many other healthcare professions (e.g. medicine).

Our class was supposed to be licensed in June; it's almost November now, and not a single person is licensed to work as a pharmacist because our board exams are postponed indefinitely. In fact, **most of our class will be unable to practice until June of 2021 at the earliest, one full year after graduating,** coinciding with the class of 2021. As unlicensed pharmacy grads, we are being asked to work for minimum wage while taking on the full scope of activities as a pharmacist. Other professions, like medicine, have granted conditional licensure in light of COVID. How come pharmacy didn't waive offer the same thing? Despite the line-ups you may see in pharmacies right now for flu-shots and other services, our regulatory body told us we *""aren't needed enough""* to receive conditional licensure to practice.

How did they decide that? Well, they sent out surveys to practicing pharmacists, specifically those in the community setting (e.g. Shoppers/Rexall), to gage need. There was a clear conflict of interest because pharmacy owners want to hire labour as cheaply as possible, and they know that if we aren't licensed, we can perform all the duties of a licensed pharmacist for minimum wage. And this is exactly what happened. After OCP deemed that there was no need for immediate licensure, every Shoppers/Rexall started looking *specifically* for unlicensed grads, offering $15/hr at best, often < 10hrs/ week. To add salt to the wound, we had to pay OCP a fee to work as unlicensed grads. To put this into perspective, our licensing exam > $4000; you would have to work over 260 hrs just to breakeven. And quite frankly, OCP has little interest in entertaining when they are willing to grant us licensure; they stated that **adequate intern renumeration and professional areas are not areas of interest to OCP** (please see pics). Is this for the better of the profession and the public, or greed and indifference? I will let you draw your own conclusions.

**Faculty sold us out to retail chains, knowingly compromising our health, while they worked safely from home.**

When COVID started peaking in March, many UofT pharmacy students were finishing their *unpaid* placements in retail chains. While medicine cancelled these placements for student safety, our faculty sent the chains an email - without consulting us, and without our knowledge - indicating that pharmacy students would be more than willing to uphold the needs of the community and stay true to the profession by continuing to practice (ironically - due to *increased need* for pharmacy services, as a public duty). This is after the hospitals cancelled their rotations and sent students home. Faculty showed absolutely no regard to our safety; they made this decision from their ivory tower, safely working at home, purposely keeping the correspondence hidden from students directly in harm's way; there was inadequate PPE, many lived with immunocompromised family members - and keep in mind, these rotations were unpaid, and we had to pay tuition to the school while working in this environment. Only after the lockdowns came in full force did they retract their original statement.

**What are pharmacy grads doing right now?**

Many are working for minimum wage in retail for financial reasons. There have been discussions on a loan repayment program. Some went back to undergrad, some just quit the field. I know for you sure if you ask my colleagues right now if they regret pharmacy school, > 90% would tell you they wish they did something else. Don't believe me? I will let the pictures do the talking.

Feel free to share for awareness.

**EDIT: How can you help?**

Thank you *so much* for the support and kind words. If you can share this post to other venues (any that you might think is relevant/be interested to hear about this), it would really help. This post got deleted in the PrePharmacy and similar forums. The more people who are aware, the more likely a bigger outlet will pick it up.

I agree taking this public is probably the best course of action, but our student leaders have been unwilling to do so in fear of retaliation by the school. We would be really grateful for your help.

**EDIT 2:** Just received a response to this post from the group in question. Despite my best attempt to advocate for our profession here, my post was criticized by our purported student leaders due to its anonymous nature; ironic they say this because they never entertained the venues where real advocacy could be achieved (e.g. the media) - this is the fear of retaliation I have been trying to stress, and also the downfall of our profession. Everyone superficially agrees now on the group, and the voices of reason are drowned out again. They are all too afraid to speak up. I expected better, but I was sorely disappointed. Don't be like us.

Note 2: Links to the BC Gratuities and Redistribution of Gratuities Act will be at the bottom. 

Tipping culture needs to gooooo and the only way tipping culture will end here is if we all collectively stop doing it and spread the message. With inflation and the cost of living soaring in BC, plus the fact that all BC worker make a minimum of $16 no matter the industry is more than enough reason to end it. 

• Argument that it supplements a workers wage because they don’t make minimum wage

———-False in BC it’s law that all workers make minimum wage. 

•Argument that workplaces automatically take 5%-10% of you wage to tip out no matter what 

———-That’s illegal and you should contact the proper authorities as the the law clearly states only gratuities can be pooled and split 

• Argument that it’s a service job and someone’s doing something for you, like walking back and forth from the kitchen…. 

——— There’s many many many service jobs that exist that don’t take tips and make minimum wage only. Why is that someone who works at McDonald’s and arguably has a much more stressful job than someone working at Cactus server, makes no tips but the cactus server does. 


I would like to discuss this with further will be and would love to hear what other people think. Personally I think the message needs to spread now more than ever. The only way we stop the culture is to actually stop doing it ourselves. Collectively we could make it end and it could also start making work places pay a livable wage to people.

17877,your have given so many of us some hope much needed hope,From F’s to Straight A’s: How I Went From Academic Suspension to a Near 4.0,2019-10-24 04:17:01,UofT,Other,"In light of recent happenings at UofT surrounding mental health, I’d thought I’d share my journey in overcoming my own MH issues, and hopefully lending a helping hand to those who may be in a similar situation

Here’s a snapshot of my first semester at UofT compared to my latest Summer semester grades.

https://i.redd.it/l1rc7ekpxeu31.jpg

Putting it lightly, my first year (I’m in life sci) was an absolute shit show. I failed a lot of my courses and barely passed the others. I was, unbeknownst to myself, struggling with severe depression and loneliness that followed me from high school. Being as my family had moved away and I struggled to make any friends, I spent most of my days alone, even while living on res. I would go days without speaking to anyone besides family without even noticing it.

Eventually, I finished 1st year and was placed on academic probation. I thought that over the summer I’d be able to somehow get my shit together, but my ‘second year’ was even worse. Ultimately, I was placed on academic suspension for a year.

At this point, without disclosing too much, I decided to seek professional help. This took care of a lot of my issues, but I still felt very unmotivated. What really made the biggest difference for me was having a serious talk with myself about what I wanted to do with my life. Why did I choose to go to UofT? What am I even studying all this? 

I realized I was living life without *intention*. 

I knew I wanted to do something great. And I somehow knew that I was in the right school and this degree would ultimately help me. But I wasn’t fully committed to making that happen. My focus was skewed (or simply non-existent). Let me tell you, the greatest thing to ever happen to me in my academic career was getting suspended. Not only did it act as a wake-up call, but it allowed me to take a step back and perform a diagnostic check on myself. 

With a refreshed mindset and proper MH treatment, I was able to come back to UofT and for once feel like a student, not a failure.

For anyone whose struggling to find hope or believe they’re too far gone, it’s never too late. I still struggle today as a 3/4th year student but I’ve learned to recognize my warning signs and overcome them.

Here’s some tips from what I learned these past few years: 

1. The first step in getting any help is actually *recognizing* you need it. There is no shame in asking for it. A lot of mental illnesses actually make you believe you don't have them and instead your issues are attributed to laziness. If you have an inkling, you're probably right.
2. Encourage yourself to take a step back every now and then to self-check. Ask yourself how you’re doing. What do you need? Why do you need it? What can you do to make yourself feel better? 
3. Try to gain some practical experience by volunteering, interning, or even working. During my suspension year I started volunteering at a hospital. This role not only solidified that I did not want to pursue a medical career, but also aided greatly in my recovery. Sometimes, having a repetitive job/task can train you in developing self-regulatory skills like time management (while gaining useful experience). 
4. UofT is not for everyone, and that's okay. If you are seriously struggling academically at UofT, try looking at other programs, universities, or colleges. You may be better suited for a practical profession. Don’t torture yourself by studying something you’re not passionate or interested in.
5. Accessibility Services has saved my life. If you believe you're struggling with a disability (mental or physical), no matter how major or minor, book an appointment with an advisor. You don't need to be diagnosed with 10 different disorders to be accommodated.
6. On the same note, your college/faculty has a bunch of resources that I’ve used over these years, namely Learning Specialists. Even a single meeting can provide you with valuable tips on how to build an effective study plan.
7. Speaking of study plans, try to find a method of taking notes that works best for you. I started out handwriting notes, but found that it really discouraged me from studying because it would take forever to create them. I now type notes, print them, and revise with a whiteboard. Everybody learns differently.
8. Don’t feel pressured to take a full course load. I find that taking a reduced course load in the fall/winter plus summer school works best for me. This way I don’t feel overwhelmed. 
9. Also, do not feel pressured to complete your degree in 4 years. I’m entering my 3rd year of study, but my 5th year at UofT. It‘s a little disheartening and tough to see my peers graduating, but I know that I’m putting myself first and that’s all that matters. I’d rather gain valuable experience and improve my GPA than to finish “on-time” with a shitty one.
10. Lastly, take care of yourself. It’s very redundant to say, but it’s extremely important to recognize signs of burnout or mental exhaustion. Listen to your body and mind.

I hope that someone can take hope from this all. As always, my DM’s are open if anyone wants a chat. 

Take care! Be strong! You got this!

TL;DR: Failed my first couple years. Took care of my mental health and perspective. Came back with straight A’s.

Edit: Thank you everyone for the kind words. As mentioned, my most recent grades are from Summer courses, which I agree are generally easier to do well in. However, I usually take 4-5 courses in the regular school year and perform similarity as well. Also, I completely understand and respect that not everyone has access to the opportunities and decisions I was able to take. In that case, I hope that I was able to at least give you some hope in knowing that there’s always light at the end of the tunnel. I wish you all the best, and thank you once again!","['given', 'many', 'u', 'hope', 'much', 'needed', 'hope']",,0.7003,given many u hope much needed hope
32071,top university they use this to make people go still,U of T abuses its students and treats them like crap,2024-08-15 06:32:35,UofT,Rant,"I attended the University of Toronto at the St. George campus from September 2016 to January 2019. I can tell you from experience that U of T treats its students like dog crap. Many of my peers took 5-6 years to graduate rather than the standard 4. This is no accident - U of T overloads its students with coursework in order to make them fail/retake courses and to take more of their (their parents') money. Some professors try to resist this immoral system, but U of T's administration threatens to fire them if they don't comply. Many hard-working, intelligent, and ambitious students attend the University of Toronto. Many of them are first or second generation Canadians who come from poor or underprivileged backgrounds and are trying to get a decent education in the hopes of getting a decent job later. U of T exploits these kinds of students without any kind of restraint or remorse. 

The truth is, a lot of evil lives at the University of Toronto. Much of it comes from people like Merrick Gertler and rest of the U of T administration, who act with great cruelty towards their students. During my time at the U of T, I suffered anxiety attacks, watched the university take vast sums of money from wealthy Chinese students, and saw first year Economics professors brag to my face about how most of their students fail their course and have to take it again several times just to enter their desired major. I also saw many students, including myself, who came to U of T thinking that their desired major was a given, only to have to compete in the unethical POST system to try and enter their desired major. 

None of this is normal. None of this is OK. After having studied at the University of Arizona for 3 years, I understand what it's like for a university to treat its students with decency, love, and respect. I knew no such feeling at the U of T. All I knew there was deception, abuse, and neglect. For all of you U of T kids who know in your souls that how this university treats its students is very far from acceptable, I want you to know that your intuition is correct. None of this is OK.

I hope that one day, the University of Toronto will change its terrible ways. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like this will happen anytime soon. Poor immigrants keep coming to Canada in search of a better life, and their children keep displaying the ambition that will one day lead them to U of T despite the dire warnings of their peers. Wealthy Chinese parents continue to be willing to pay enormous sums for a chance to send their children to the West. And so the cycle continues. 

I'll never forget the feeling of sitting in a lecture room at U of T, watching a professor lecture, and feeling like  U of T is trying to crush me into dust. To say that this experience isn't normal would be a big understatement. Anyways, I just wanted to say all of this because I think that it's about time that someone told the truth about the University of Toronto.

I was born in Toronto and have had the privilege of a life without civil war. My only stake in this situation is that I was a student during the fall/winter semester when the conflict started hitting headlines and I’ll be graduating in June. I’ll be observing the people who will be protesting on convocation day alongside my peers, who have all been pretty quiet about this topic. This post is for the people who are curious to know what their graduation ceremony is going to look like if its at the convocation hall next week.

The impression I got from this encampment was this: it was quiet, there wasnt anybody blocking doors to the adjacent buildings, and there wasnt really an air of chaos that has been exaggerated on insta. Its peaceful. It was just asian tourists visiting the campus for their kids and people going to and from class. There is an entrance to the encampment thats being guarded by a handful of people, but not much human activity. Of the 6 whole protestors I saw, it wasnt exactly a mixed group, but my sample size is too low to really confirm anything. No they were not wearing masks or trying to conceal their identity. Unfortunately it smells like weed and other things you could guess would come from an encampment, but thats to be expected. In contrast, there was a lot of construction going on and contractors working all around the encampment. I feel a little bad. That whole stretch of park has no shade so I wager its hot as hell in there.

So no, Kings College isnt a warzone, and you can go about convocation without feeling unsafe. There are a number of places where you can take decent pictures without getting tents in the background. Nobody is blocking doors and going after eachother.

—

One person on this reddit said that uoft put the fence up to deliberately stop the anticipation of a protest, but after visiting today I think that’s just bs. 🤦‍♀️ I counted at least 3 other sites that were fenced off for construction and landscaping all around the circle. Plus, the work that is being prepared for the circle was no different from the construction on Robarts and Woodsworth. Its ironic that this same fence is now being used as a barrier preventing contractors, or really anybody, from entering the park. I did not try to enter this checkpoint thing, and I’m aware that other journalists have attempted to do this with varying results.

I finally formed an opinion on this. I think it’s great that people are practicing their freedom of expression. You should be allowed to advocate for vulnerable groups without getting shot by cops. While I think the war/crimes against humanity is awful, I actually don’t really support the encampment and their demands. Literally every facet of our country has had a direct and indirect involvement in supporting warfare beyond our borders. So even if they were to succeed in getting UofT to stop being involved with companies like Hebrew University of Jerusalem(??), or the Daughters for Life Foundation (?????) I honestly dont believe the unrelenting warfare in the middle east-east asia will ever really end. Children will still die at the same rate, relief workers will still die, genocides are still going to be funded by Canadian corpos, families will still face tragedy, and the isms will continue onward because nobody can agree on how the borders should be redrawn. 

A brief crash course on the history of Israel in my undergrad still feels true to me. I know that is my oblivious privilege talking, but this is all I see before me. There are so many problems in the world and I only have the energy for the ones happening here on this side of the globe.

We dried off and layed in bed and kissed and I asked him if there was anything else he wanted to do, and he's like ""no, just kissing you and holding you is amazing."" He was really sweet, but I kinda felt like a hoe. That was the rest of our night until he had to get on the bus. I talked to him later via snapchat after he left.

The truth is that the last years were insanely challenging. I had several days where my supervisor suggested that I withdraw since my mental health was very paralyzing. I started struggling with my mental health few months after starting my first semester at McGill. I actually never had time to take a breath, as bad things were coming one after the other, and I thought I could never make it to be honest. 

I failed so many assignments, cried myself to bed most of the time, I took a leave of absence and I lost count of the number of medical notes I required. I had days where I was insomniac for three days in row and even sleep pills couldn't help with it. I struggled with my sexuality and lost most my friends when it was time to come out, I experienced grief, assault, the death of my closest family members without being able to go home and see them, major depression, abandoment, loneliness, and I litteraly had no motivation to keep working on my studies. 

If I could make it, I want you to know that you could do it too, no matter how shitty or bad things are now. Try to ask for help, it is a sign of strength, talk to people, a lot of them at McGill are willing to help, or can show you resources to make things easier for you. Be extra compassionate with yourself, as we are litteraly in a middle of a pandemic, celebrate small achievements such as getting out of bed in the morning, don't compare yourself to others, life isn't a competition and only you knows what's going on in your life and heart, many of my friends graduated before me, and it made me feel isolated, but I realized that we are all different and we have different stories, that my productivity doesn't say anything about my worth as I was taught all my life.

77611,tipping is never mandatory if its automatically on your bill then thats not a tip,"Why We, as UBC Students, Should Rethink the Tipping Culture on Campus",2024-01-31 23:20:59,UBC,Discussion," 

Hey fellow UBC students,

I'm here to open a discussion about a practice we've all become accustomed to: tipping at restaurants, especially the ones on our campus. I believe it's time we seriously reconsider this tipping culture, and here's why:

1. **Not Our Responsibility**: Firstly, it’s not our job as customers to worry about the finances of restaurant workers. This is a matter that should be strictly between the worker and their employer. Our role is to pay for the service and food provided, not to ensure the financial well-being of the employees.
2. **Arbitrary System**: The percentage-based tipping system is inherently arbitrary. For instance, why should a $10 tip be standard for a $50 bill but a $20 tip for a $100 bill? The effort put in by the worker doesn’t necessarily increase proportionally with the bill total.
3. **Bias and Inequality**: There's evidence suggesting that tipping can promote racism and sexism. Studies have shown that [black and minority workers often receive less in tips compared to their white counterparts](https://ecommons.cornell.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/8b1667d9-5040-4e46-aa80-2b949c8c37f4/content). Similarly, [attractive women tend to receive more tips](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/EDI-04-2019-0127/full/html). This is an unfair system that fosters discrimination.
4. **Why Just Waiters?**: Many other jobs, some more challenging than waiting tables, do not receive tips. It's unclear why waiting staff should be an exception. Additionally, the argument that waiters make less than minimum wage and rely on tips is misleading. Legally, employers are required to pay the waiters above the minimum wage threshold.

In conclusion, I strongly urge all of us at UBC to take a stand against the ingrained tipping culture. It's high time that we recognize that the financial responsibility of employees lies with the employers, not the customers. We should advocate for fair and just compensation practices directly from the employers. By collectively choosing not to tip, we send a powerful message that supports a more equitable and transparent system of compensation. Let's be the change and encourage our campus restaurants to adopt fair wage policies, ensuring that their employees are adequately and fairly compensated without relying on the unpredictable and often biased system of tipping.

87934,i feel like that has to be a typo and it was an extinguisher how does one even remove a fire hydrant from the ground let alone fill it with paint,McGill terminates its relationship with SSMU,2025-04-07 17:45:27,McGill,MEGATHREAD,"Well, I never expected it to actually happen. But it did. Any thoughts? I think it goes without saying that this is likely going to be disastrous for the undergraduate student body if SSMU doesn't compromise.

Transcript is as follows:

*Dear McGill students,*

*I write today to inform you that the University has made the difficult decision to terminate its current contractual relationship with the Students' Society of McGill University (SSMU). Under the terms of the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between McGill and the SSMU, either party is permitted to end the relationship with no fault assigned, provided that mediation is attempted beforehand. We will, of course, honour that process and engage in it in good faith.*

*That said, I want to be fully transparent with you about why we have taken this step and what it means for you.*

*Let me begin by acknowledging that the SSMU plays an important and historic role in representing undergraduate students at McGill. Many of its services and advocacy initiatives are deeply valued by the community, and several members of the SSMU’s leadership this year have worked hard, in good faith, with the University administration. They have demonstrated a sincere commitment to representing their peers and improving student life for all undergraduates.*

*However, the SSMU’s leadership has been neither unanimous nor explicit in dissociating itself from or rejecting groups without recognized status at McGill that endorse or engage in acts of vandalism, intimidation, and obstruction as forms of activism. We reject this, unequivocally. Protest is indeed part of university life—our policies and the law protect peaceful assembly and freedom of expression. But vandalism, obstruction, threats, and violence do not fall within these protections. They violate our collective values and our policies, and they damage the trust and safety of our community.*

*Last week, SSMU allowed and, at least tacitly, supported a three-day strike that further divided a campus community already deeply cleaved and hurting. The SSMU can and should have ruled the motion that led to the strike referendum as out of order given SSMU’s governing documents, but opted against this. The result was a campus environment in which dozens of classes were blocked or interrupted. Students and instructors were unable to teach or learn. Many felt threatened, intimidated, and unsafe. This culminated in an incident in which individuals smashed a glass office door using a fire hydrant filled with red paint. The paint was sprayed throughout the office while staff were inside. One staff member was hit directly.*

*Let me be clear: No one at McGill—no student, no staff member, no instructor or faculty member—should ever have to experience this at their place of work or study. This behaviour is unacceptable, and I denounce it in the strongest possible terms.*

*These tactics do nothing to support or advance the causes they purport to advance. They divide our community and threaten to foment hate against groups who are already vulnerable.*

*While the SSMU has since issued a statement reaffirming its commitment to peaceful protest and recognizing that some events during the strike turned violent, McGill University remains deeply concerned about the consequences of this strike. A commitment to peaceful protest must be demonstrated not just in words but in practice. The University will continue to prioritize the safety and well-being of all members of our community as we move forward.*

*I am aware that some in our community have viewed McGill's communications as conveying bias in favour of one group or another. I take these concerns seriously and have reflected on them carefully in writing to you today. My goal is not to silence dissent, but to affirm that all students—whatever their identity or politics—deserve to live, learn, and express themselves on a campus free of fear, harassment, or violence, where their dignity is respected.*

*As we move forward, the University will enter the mediation process with SSMU in the spirit of resolution. Should that process not allow us to sustain the MOA, we are fully committed to ensuring that students continue to have strong, democratic representation and uninterrupted access to critical services. The well-being and academic success of all our students will remain our foremost priority.*

*I will continue to keep you informed as we navigate this process. Thank you for your attention, and for your ongoing care for one another in these challenging times.*

*Sincerely,*

*Professor Angela Campbell*

*Interim Deputy Provost, Student Life and Learning*","['feel', 'like', 'typo', 'extinguisher', 'one', 'even', 'remove', 'fire', 'hydrant', 'ground', 'let', 'alone', 'fill', 'paint']",,-0.2263,feel like typo extinguisher one even remove fire hydrant ground let alone fill paint

I've written this post because I don't feel like I can speak my mind at McGill. 

What I've realized is that there is a lot of dogmatism on this campus, particularly concerning issues of social justice. Critiquing any progressive ideas can prompt accusations of bigotry, insensitivity, or even violence. It's easy not to notice this dogmatism because dissent has been discouraged, making some ideas about social justice appear self-evident. 

To be clear, I'm not a far-right wingnut. I'm a democratic socialist who wants an end to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. But I'm also alarmed by the stifling intellectual environment surrounding social justice at McGill. Enforcing ideological purity by shaming dissenters is something I'd expect to come from the far-right, not left-wing McGillians. 

All of the unproductive behaviours I will identify in this post are things I have been personally guilty of. By writing this post, I hope to draw attention to a problem I am partly responsible for.

I've spoken to many left-wing McGillians who feel they can't speak freely about certain progressive ideas, for fear of being labeled bigots. Here are some examples:

* Women who think that aspects of the MeToo movement are overblown or unproductive
* Professors who think that progressive ideas about mental health have created a culture of self-victimization and learned helplessness
* Black students who disagree with elements of recent anti-racist ideas; feel uncomfortable around many progressive white students because they try to acknowledge blackness instead of acting colourblind
* Queer students who feel uncomfortable in the LGBTQ+ movement because of its lack of ideological diversity and expectations surrounding dress, appearance, and tone of voice
* Students who have experienced rape, sexual assault who think that the current approach to sexual violence worsens mental health outcomes
* Science students who are alarmed by the anti-scientific attitudes of some left-wing McGillians, who deny any scientific facts that could potentially be abused for right-wing purposes (such as existence of human nature and innate aggregate sex differences between men and women)
* Liberal students and professors who are concerned about the state of free speech on campuses, but don't want to be seen as right-wingers

These people only shared their views after I made it clear that I wouldn't shame them for their opinions. By approaching political conversations more openly, I realized that many left-wing McGillians disagree with certain progressive ideas, but don't feel comfortable saying so. 

All of this is bad for three reasons. Firstly, we need open discourse in order to expand our minds. Listening to the people who disagree with us, instead of assuming they are bigots because we don't like their views, is a great way to sharpen our political thinking. A broadened perspective is one of the main rewards of a university education, but the current intellectual environment is robbing many of us of this benefit.

Secondly, freedom of speech is important in itself. It's necessary for democracy and good citizenship. How can we properly debate the social and political issues that affect our society if we routinely shame dissenters? Many of the ideas that we consider fundamental to the wellbeing of our society now were controversial a short time ago. 

Finally, closed intellectual environments harm social justice movements, in two ways. Firstly, shutting down dissent alienates potential allies. Shaming others for disagreeing with us is profoundly obnoxious. It communicates moral arrogance and makes others feel unheard and aggrieved. There is a reason the far-right has seized on the issue of free speech on campuses. They know that our approach to speech we disagree with is deeply unpopular.

Secondly, treating progressive ideas as sacrosanct allows bad ideas to flourish, undermining the efficacy of social justice activism. Activists in this environment become less capable of communicating effectively with the public, since their ideas are tailored to people who already agree with them.

I'm confident that leaving space for disagreement would raise the quality of discourse, broaden the minds of students, and strengthen social justice activism. Restoring intellectual openness would benefit all of us. Let's create a campus where we can speak our minds.

\-  Quebec civil servants could face disciplinary measures if they speak or communicate in English with citizens deemed ineligible.

\-  There are no guarantees ensuring emergency services like 911 or Urgences-Santé ambulances would continue to be offered in English. 

\-  The elimination of knowledge of English as a criterion for selecting judges and no requirement for judges to speak English in Quebec court houses.

We will write what we can with personal identifiers removed.

&#x200B;

UBC Medicine class of 2024 has recently admitted a student who is a pharmacist and a former associate (owner) of Shoppers Drug Mart in Vancouver. He was recently suspended for 540 days in 2019 due to malpractice involving dispening of medications under the name of patients without their consent or awareness. 

This is a guy who is known for having huge influence in the area, and had the power to permanently remove a person from a position in Shoppers Drug Mart using his connections. Using his position of power, he would force his staffs to do tasks that are unethical for the sole purpose of making some extra cash for himself. It wasn't until recent years that BC College of Pharmacists caught him for his shady business and suspending his practice.

There is a report on the college website elaborating his misconduct, and he was even mentioned on Vancouver Sun article. The links were not included because it leads to information containing identifiers and my post will be taken down again.

Recently, we found out that this person has been granted admission to UBC Medicine, and was quite concerned about the consequences of having someone like him becoming a doctor in the future. To get in, it is likely that he withheld all of this information and the faculty of Medicine was not aware of his past. And of course, this would not pop on his criminal record. He is really good at presenting himself as a person of good integrity, so he probably did not have much trouble at the interview.

We really wish something can be done about this, and decided to start here trying to spread the word.

I am trying to shed some light on the current situation in Orchard Commons. We continue to have large parties in our buildings, putting the safety of residents and staff in jeopardy. Athletes continue to host and attend large parties, both against the provincial COVID-19 orders and UBC Housing rules. 

* Men's and Women's Track and Field/Cross Country has had parties of 15+ people this week with no masks
* Women's Hockey also is holding and attending large parties within our building.

With the P1 variant, we need to take additional precautions. These two teams have shown blatant disregard and/or do not care.

I suggest that these teams are removed from Orchard Commons as they pose a dangerous threat to the rest of us, students. Coaches should remove these students from all practices and games (if they are happening) because they now threaten infecting other athletes. UBC administration should investigate these incidents, and all students who attend a large gathering (15-20+ people) should receive non-academic misconduct penalties.

We are kind to the people that we meet, and supportive of eachother's plans. However, this creates huge problems. First years never truly get a meaningful or representative sounding board, and fall into pitfalls that are difficult to escape. They reach 4th year not realizing that they wasted their whole degree because of bad advice they got from the get-go.

We need to stop lying to first years. We need to stop being supportive of bad planning. We need to call out poor decision-making when we see it. 

If people had called out my plans early on within my degree, I would've made much better life decisions.

* You should not be supportive of HS students whose plan it is to transfer from Arts to Sauder/Science/Engineering. Internal transfers are competitive and comparatively more difficult than transfers from colleges/engineering transfer programs. It is true that HS grades are almost never a predictor of academic success at UBC, but poor HS grades are usually a good predictor of poorer academic outcomes at UBC. (i.e. good grades doesn't mean you'll do above average at UBC, but poor grades are a pretty good indicator that you won't do well). Most of them need to suck up their pride and seriously do their first year (of their intended program) in a more gradual transition environment like Langara college, instead of risking the possibility of studying something they hate just to get a degree. 

* You should not go along with first year pre-meds who think that it's a good idea to take on 20 club exec positions to improve their chances of med school. Not only is it not going to help, it's going to leave actual clubs working towards meaningful goals with a lot of dead weight execs who are just doing it for the resume.

* Club experience is not a replacement for meaningful part-time or internship experience. A 10hr/week Work Learn job processing receipts and finance claims, or doing front desk at a rental agency, is going to get you way farther in landing your first internship in accounting than a president of some rando charity club.

* You should not encourage students without the means to not live at home and do first year res because of all the friends they might meet, because the crippling student debt they'll take on is ""worth it"". Student debt can seriously set people back in their life plans (saving up for a house/start a family/wedding) and doesn't go away in a bankruptcy.

* You shouldn't do iSci just because some 6th year Science students who couldn't get into med school recommend it as a good idea to boost your GPA.

* Don't just talk about how awesome your internships and your program. There are bad sides to literally every program, and it's important to be transparent and honest. You will never have a perfect fit, and you will face challenges no matter what, but being honest can really improve the decision-making abilities of first years.

There's so much bad advice and fake supportiveness that's tossed around at UBC, and it leads to people going down a trajectory of making bad decisions for themselves. It's uncomfortable to be the naysayer, but you should be frank and upfront in the most respectful way you can.

I'm a 4th year now. Many of my friends are too, or have graduated. The bad advice we got in first year put us in positions where we now need to work extra hard to overcome.","['two', 'people', 'know', 'government', 'work', 'biology', 'work', 'interior', 'didnt', 'need', 'extra', 'training', 'one', 'job', 'lined', 'right', 'away', 'though', 'took', 'year', 'think', 'thats', 'reasonable', 'find', 'career', 'understand', 'saying', 'though', 'dont', 'real', 'knowledge', 'life', 'science', 'degree']",,0.0,two people know government work biology work interior didnt need extra training one job lined right away though took year think thats reasonable find career understand saying though dont real knowledge life science degree

38077,the fact that op claims to know individuals who are miserable because their lives arent enriched by humanities courses is beyond pretentious and hyperbolic its pretty ridiculous to claim that without some background in humanities the average cs or life sci student cant be educated and appreciative of things like philosophy and film alot of what op is giving a humanities education credit for is just basic formative education and life experience but please continue to act like individuals cannot appreciate or participate in cultural pastimes without a humanities education,"I think the demeaning of the importance of humanities is leading to a narrow minded, unhappy society.",2020-05-04 13:44:41,UofT,Discussion,"Now let me preface this by saying that stem and humanities rely on each other. Without one, the other would lose so much importance. I think other college kids would agree that STEM is being pushed to the forefront and that earning money and being “useful” is all that matters. I will say that there’s a much more practical application and clear progression toward jobs and financial security than if you majored in humanities. I think that’s due to lack of job training and clear cut options given to students, and a problem that needs to be addressed. But so many people are unfulfilled and unhappy because our values and culture and core characteristics of humanity are being dismissed or neglected. There’s a reason so many people resonate with quotes, media, books, etc. it’s because they allow us to understand what we value and how to work towards and live by those values. But what’s being enforced through education and imposed on the youth is something that is noble in intention, but misguided to say the least. The value isn’t being conveyed, and thus people with poor values are ruining our world. It’s no coincidence, don’t you think?

Humanities aren’t useless. They’re essential. They enrich our lives and help us understand more about the world in a different, but just as valid, way than stem. If you really think about it, what STEM achieves to do literally STEM’s (Sorry) from the humanities. They inspire curiosity, hope, dreams, and a way forward. Progress.

Lots of kids I know are miserable because their lives aren’t enriched by the humanities and they’re told that STEM fields are the only fields that matter and making money is of the utmost importance. If you can sell yourself and you’re good at what you do, it doesn’t matter what you major in. So yes, it may be easier to BS your way through a humanities degree, but understanding it at the highest level is nothing to scoff at. Something I think people should strive to achieve outside of their work, if their work is STEM related.

Let me be clear. I’m not saying one is better than the other. But great things are achieved when multiple different types people work together to create something amazing. Now arguing about what is best and what is “right.” I’m a computer science major myself, but I encourage all of you students to study literature, film, philosophy, whatever interests/enriches you life. Because being well-rounded and understanding reasoning and examining our history is how we do not repeat mistakes. It’s how we decide the best way to use our technological, medicinal, and other practical advancements. Without humanities is no way to live. Without STEM, people don’t get the opportunity to live. Both are amazing. Just know whatever you choose to study isn’t the end all be all. And don’t be cornered into studying something that doesn’t interest you just because it’s what you’re “supposed” to do. I truly believe that so many of our problems are due to people who have expertise in a skill but don’t examine or question the morality or validity of it all. I think there’s a Socrates quote related to this, but I’m blanking right now. Imagine working your 9-5 and coming home and not having a form of entertainment. Understand why those are meaningful to you. Just because it’s not understood to many, doesn’t mean it’s unimportant.

Tl;DR: don’t demean other fields and disciplines. They’re all important. Learn, read, write, and go on a lifelong quest for doing something good that fulfills you, while also considering practicality. Jobs run on practical application, but knowing how to sell yourself and communicate is essential.","['fact', 'op', 'claim', 'know', 'individual', 'miserable', 'life', 'arent', 'enriched', 'humanity', 'course', 'beyond', 'pretentious', 'hyperbolic', 'pretty', 'ridiculous', 'claim', 'without', 'background', 'humanity', 'average', 'c', 'life', 'sci', 'student', 'cant', 'educated', 'appreciative', 'thing', 'like', 'philosophy', 'film', 'alot', 'op', 'giving', 'humanity', 'education', 'credit', 'basic', 'formative', 'education', 'life', 'experience', 'please', 'continue', 'act', 'like', 'individual', 'appreciate', 'participate', 'cultural', 'pastime', 'without', 'humanity', 'education']",,0.7971,fact op claim know individual miserable life arent enriched humanity course beyond pretentious hyperbolic pretty ridiculous claim without background humanity average c life sci student cant educated appreciative thing like philosophy film alot op giving humanity education credit basic formative education life experience please continue act like individual appreciate participate cultural pastime without humanity education

9023,smt,A prof's perspective on integrity,2020-04-28 05:40:37,UofT,Academics,"It seems that people in this sub think that every prof out there is a person who is obsessed with making students' lives miserable. It also seems as if people aren't even aware that profs are humans, too. Humans who are - for the vast majority - trying their very best in this situation. Humans who - just like students - can feel burdened, freaked out or stressed.

So, just for your entertainment, let me share some stories with you.

Background: I am a Prof in a Department in the Faculty of Arts and Science (I will not answer questions about which department or what general field).

* Imagine you mark the take home final exam and a student who scored 25% and 30% in term tests all of a sudden scores 95% in a final exam.
* Imagine you make your take home final open book and everything. You warn your students not to seek for solutions online. And still, within an hour, your exam is posted 40 times all over the internet on websites, asking for solutions.
* Imagine you have a case where a student's submission is a verbatim copy (to the very last punctuation mark) of a solution found on one of those websites and you invite that student to a meeting and they are telling you a story that is so bullshit you can't even.
* Imagine you have a student who submits a solution using vocabulary that you never ever remotely covered in this class and is only used in advanced courses of your field (suggesting that they had the solution written up by a for-hire grad student making some extra cash)
* Imagine you come to this sub before exam season and it is full of students asking for advice what Quercus tracks and what the prof can see, i.e. directly asking for advice on how to cheat.
* Imagine you also have to read in this sub endless posts saying that basically cheating is okay because it's easy and everyone is doing it anyways and profs are stupid to expect anyone not to cheat.
* Imagine you get messages from students who are anxious that they are the only honest one and that they are concerned that their peers will cheat but they don't want to cheat and it is freaking them out.

Now imagine seeing all this happen not just once but you have 60 cases of this, spread out over the online assignments in your course.

Oh and please don't tell me ""you are naive for expecting students not to cheat"". None of us wanted to go online. We had to. The faculty forced us to have online final exams. So we have to make it work somehow. Do you want us to say ""hey, cheating is okay, who cares, byeeeeee?"" Should we just give everyone an A++++?  How is that fair to the students who take the exact same course last year?

There are academic standards we have to uphold. There also is our own integrity as an academic that we have to uphold.

The admin load for profs has gone through the roof. Many of us have been working literally every waking hour since mid march. This is not an exaggeration. I have done nothing since mid march but sleep, eat, grocery shopping and work.

I have colleagues right now who can't sleep because they are just devastated by the rampant amount of cheating.  Profs are left entirely alone. They are not criminologists and yet they have to figure out cases, decide what evidence is ""solid"" or just ""circumstancial"" or what not. Why is everyone expecting us to be perfect investigators? I have a PhD in my field. I am a researcher and educator. I am not a trained criminal investigator.

Also if a Prof doesn't follow through with a case where they think an offence might have occured (even just ever so slightly suspecting it), they themselves commit an academic offence and can be sanctioned. Anything we suspect we must pursue or WE are the ones in trouble.

So if we look at your work and think ""looking at this, it's more likely they didn't cheat, but still it is suspicious enough to justify further investigation"", then you will be contacted.

So are some of you being contacted because of alleged cheating although you didn't do anything. Yes.Will you be penalized if you didn't cheat? No. Because all cases eventually go to the dean's office where they know very well how to handle evidence. But we aren't allowed to forward cases to the dean's office before jumping through the hoops of evidence collection and student meetings.

Academic offences are very different from criminal cases but let me entertain that failed analogy for a moment: The police has to go after anyone suspected of stealing. Then they collect evidence. Then a judge decides.

**You cannot expect to never be suspected of stealing just because you never stole something.**

It is a defining aspect of investigations that many innocent people will be suspected of an offence. Welcome to life.

EDIT: I want to clarify my last statement since people seem to like to misinterpret it. I am NOT saying that innocent people should be assumed to be guilty until proven innocent. I am only saying that innocent people will be investigated sometimes due to suspicions. That's something entirely different from ""guilty until proven innocent"".

EDIT 2: I want to also emphasize that I am not saying that the current process for integrity cases is good. Trust me, we don't like the 5,000 hoops we need to jump through either. The fact is that the process is so complicated and convoluted because students sued the university. These students didn't sue the university on grounds that they didn't cheat. Instead they sued the university that the process of how they were found guilty was not elaborate enough. That's the reason why it is this mammoth system now. We don't like it either.

EDIT 3: Thanks everyone for the conversation. This was really insightful. I also learned a lot more about the student perspective. I gotta run and will probably not monitor this post anymore. Have a great summer!",['smt'],,0.0,smt

81302,yes it is thank you for your contribution,I'm running to become your CS SUS Rep,2021-10-29 23:55:59,UBC,,"Hi, I'm u/Positivelectron0 and I'm running to be your rep.

Sure, I'm post-cs, but at least at some point I was in CS.   


Let’s get to the point; as your leader, I’ll make extravagant promises which won’t be delivered.

1. The undergrad servers currently run OpenSuSE. This is unacceptable. The (justified) superiority we feel over other schools should be grounded in the fact that we use Arch btw. 
   1. As a logical addition, I will abolish the usage of the pizza forum in favour of IRC. We’ll install [catgirl](https://git.causal.agency/catgirl/about/) on everyone’s machines and mandate its use. This would drastically increase the quality of life for profs and TAs, as students would finally be forced to learn latex (pronounce this correctly or you’ll look like a fool).
2. Mandatory copypasta training. I’ve recently seen some bearable copypastas emerge from non-cs related fields. This is unacceptable. CS must lead the bleeding edge innovation. From now on, every CS final exam will include an open ended copypasta, where the student can mock and satirize the course. This question will be graded by an independent panel, and marks will be distributed by percentile, which will be multiplied with the exam mark to form your final mark.
3. I'm a [supporter of local artists](https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/hk82jv/i_will_pay_you_to_draw_yuri_ubc_x_sfu/). Even when the mods strike me down and remove my commissioned artwork, I stand by what I believe in: SFUwUBC catgirl yuri hentai. Thus, this time around, if you are or know an artist drawing SFW WHOLESOME SFUwUBC catgirl handholding hentai, my DMs are open and I am open to commissioning some artwork.  
(btw, shoutout to u/alyssnya for [the awesome artwork](https://imgur.com/a/upX9NmK) . For those that stuck around with me during the uships, this name should be familiar.)
4. I will petition the BC government to reinstate mandatory high school provincial exams. Then again, I could go straight to Trudeau seing he was in Tofino the other day. The level of education emerging from high schools is wildly inconsistent and that’s absolutely unacceptable and unfair. Waterloo has resorted to using offsets to compensate for varying degrees of grade inflation from various schools. Standardized testing is the only cost efficient way to measure the objective performance of both individual students, and the entire grade cohort. Exams in mathematics and English will be mandatory for every student, while exams for natural and social sciences will remain optional.  
Failing this, we will instate an entrance exam at UBC, serving the same purpose. This would be less desirable than a province-wide exam, as this would only affect students who choose to apply to UBC.
5. I will mandate MFA for the CS logins. At best, we’ll have better security. At worst, we’ll get to laugh at people who don’t like MFA.
6. I will move the CS co-op office to UBC farm.
7. All fees collected will be redirected into a collective fund, which I will personally oversee. The usage of the funds can be seen in the following breakdown:
   1. If there is no catgirl ETF:
      1. 50% XEQT (because this is an intelligent investment)
      2. 50% NYA (because the ticker is kawaii)
   2. If there is a catgirl ETF:  
 100% catgirl ETF  
Unused computing power in the undergrad servers will be redirected to mining cryptocurrency.  
In the future, this fund will be used for sponsoring catgirl research and developing nuclear fusion as a viable energy source for all of humanity.
8. My 4(not set yet) part CS real review is coming out soon :tm: btw. I'll probably release part 0 sometime, to decide (and gather feedback) on the format. Stay tuned for that.

17933,why would you post where you sleep at some bad people can find you,My life as a Homeless student at U of T. -- a guide.,2022-11-15 03:58:28,UofT,Finances,"INTRO: I am not poor or broke or nothing. I just refuse to tolerate this shitty capitalist Toronto housing market. I’ve been living and studying rent free for the last 3 months since the last minute lease I was trying to get fell through. When classes started I figured I’d try and figure out how to live in robarts while I found housing, but since then it has become a lifestyle that is pretty satisfying tbh, and allows me to save a lot of money.

Sleeping: I sleep at Robarts commons, on the armchairs on the fifth floor (If you’ve been there at 3AM you’ve probably seen me sleeping in the front area with all the armchairs and the wierd desk chair things). You can gather the pillows from the common sitting area for elevated sleep experince. I keep a blanket in my backpack at all times. It keeps me warm against the cold in literal weather sense and metaphorically against the cold UofTears culture.

Clothing and cleanliness: I have a locker at the AC, which didn’t cost me anything because I found 2 day lockers and just slapped a lock on it. I keep my clothes in there, as well as a bar of soap, my toothbrush and toothpaste, deoderant, and a towel. I shower there every morning after my workout (its bulking season my dudes).

I wash my clothes at student residences, I just slip in with my laundry bag behind some clueless first years and just act natural. Usually I try to sneak into Innis or trin, but not New College, as they require a fob for the laundry room. I don’t go to woodsworth because they have coin operated that you have to pay for, not worth my toonie.

Leisure: Like a lot of u of t students, I don’t have much of a social life. I have a couple of friends who I’ll study with sometimes, and occasionally I crash at their places (if we’ve been drinking or smthn). For fun, I practice piano in Hart House, feed the squirrels in the UC quad, and scroll through reddit.

Mental Health: Parts of this lifestyle is kinda depressing, and U of T is pretty stressful as is. Not gunna lie, I spend some time crying, and try to cope through watching anime. Schools meant to be stressful i guess, and I figure there’s only a year and a half left in my schooling, I can hold out till then. I try to cope with my depression by going on regular walks through Queens park and Scholar’s walk. It really helps.

Family: My parents don’t really know about this, and tbh, they don’t ask, I just told them that I rent a place off of Bloor for cheap. What they don’t know wont hurt them. I think my older brother suspects that something isn’t quite right: I had to be really cagey last time he passed through the city, told him my place was being deep cleaned for roaches. But I don’t think he’ll tell them, he’s pretty busy, and not a nosy dude in general.

Food: Because I’m spending money on rent, I can actually afford good healthy food. This helps me stay healthy, (probably healthier than you reading this). I snack on PB&J and baby carrots since bread and peanut butter don’t need to be refrigerated (I buy a new bag of baby carrots almost every day). I know a first year at New who occasionally lets me use his meal plan. I also eat out regularly since I can now afford it since I don’t pay rent. 40$ hot pot every sunday? Hell ya — I could pretty much do it every day with my savings!

Conclusion: I recognize that this probably isn’t the life for everyone, but it’s worked really well for me thus far. I’m not at university to live out some type of “college experience”, I’m just here to get my degree and hopefully a good paying job when I graduate. I’m going to graduate debt free, and I’ll have enough savings stashed away to almost put a down payment on a house (I’m hoping prices crash before I graduate). I hope this guide helps anyone who like me, are just tryna get through university as fast as possible, and move on to better things, without struggling with this overpriced city’s rental market.","['would', 'post', 'sleep', 'bad', 'people', 'find']",,-0.5423,would post sleep bad people find
109271,its like theyre speaking important english and then translating it directly into french which is how not to speak another language as a native english speaker its weird to describe but ill give an example that isnt in the text but inspired from one of the phrases in the first few pages of the constitution we the undersigned do proclaim the existence of the ssmu nous les soussigns proclament lexistence de le ssmu intentional french mistakes added in for accuracy,The SSMU constitutional referendum is invalid. It is about a document which does not exist.,2020-03-24 18:30:00,McGill,University Politics,"You may have noticed that the SSMU referendum includes a question about an amended constitution. In the document, it is written that only the French version of the constitution will be authoritative, unlike in the present version, where both French and English are taken to be equally authoritative.

But the document presented to us is only in English. So I asked for the French version, since that is the version which would have actual effect. And my response I received was:

> Due to time constraints as a result of the situation we’re in, the communications team was unable to produce a French version of this document. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

Further clarification from SSMU President Bryan Buraga indicated that the French version was not simply inaccessible to the communications team, but that it had not been written. According to him, the final revisions to the proposed new constitution were written twelve days ago, and there was not time to prepare a proper French translation.

Especially considering that the constitution shares much with the current version, and the revision process was continual, with many parts being already in place for months. But OK, fine. I can understand the desire to take the time with the translation, even though there are good translation companies who could do this job in 12 days. But I suppose this may be for the best. The current SSMU constitution's quality of French is absolutely awful. If you speak French ­at _all_, [read it for yourself](https://www.docdroid.net/lgR7kR8/constitution-ssmu-french-2017-11-10.pdf) and weep. It's worse than the listservs. It's clear that nobody with even a cursory knowledge of French ever read half the sentences in this document before it was approved.

So, fine, we care about French now. We even will need a whole honking fee to not fuck up what really should be a basic task for us in a French-speaking city, at a university with many native French-speaking students. Fine, I'm all for doing it right and getting, you know, the basics of French grammar down.

But what is NOT acceptable is not actually having the authoritative text of a constitution to present for the referendum. This isn't a bullshit little informal group. SSMU is an actual legal entity. It's time it started acting like one.

You CANNOT have a referendum without offering the actual authoritative text of the proposed constitution. That shit ain't kosher. Come back when you have the actual document we are supposed to be voting on, or don't come back at all. Otherwise all of this is blatantly invalid.","['like', 'theyre', 'speaking', 'important', 'english', 'translating', 'directly', 'french', 'speak', 'another', 'language', 'native', 'english', 'speaker', 'weird', 'describe', 'ill', 'give', 'example', 'isnt', 'text', 'inspired', 'one', 'phrase', 'first', 'page', 'constitution', 'undersigned', 'proclaim', 'existence', 'ssmu', 'nous', 'le', 'soussigns', 'proclament', 'lexistence', 'de', 'le', 'ssmu', 'intentional', 'french', 'mistake', 'added', 'accuracy']",,-0.2144,like theyre speaking important english translating directly french speak another language native english speaker weird describe ill give example isnt text inspired one phrase first page constitution undersigned proclaim existence ssmu nous le soussigns proclament lexistence de le ssmu intentional french mistake added accuracy

There were no chairs left for me at his seat, so I did what I always did in highschool. I sat on his lap. Its funny bc he needs me to fix his code but at the same time I am able to use my weight(I am a skinny fat, I look skinny but I’m dense) so I crush him and hes in pain. 

This whole time she's just staring at me, I look over and smile and she smiles back. Me thinking she found it funny, but she didn’t I guess.

84928,theyre probably referring to upper management at the university ie the staff hired by mcgill responsible not students the higher up the chain you go the more an admin tends to have the business interests at heart instead of the end user i would hazard a guess that floor fellows were trying to get better working conditions and admin decided instead of keeping the program going it would be cheaper to hire a staff member who is also aligned with them and not necessarily the student,"Without Floor Fellows, First Years are Falling Through the Cracks",2025-01-12 21:47:50,McGill,,"A student died yesterday. I don't know them, nor how it happened, but it happened. It would be disrespectful to the dead to speculate on what happened, but I think these two events speak to a larger issue within McGill student residences. As many of you are aware, McGill announced last year the decision to eliminate Floor Fellows in favour of so-called ""Residence Life Managers"" (RLMs). I was not a student at the time, but I know this decision was widely criticized for its potential to deprive first years of essential resources that could help them in a crisis. As far as I am aware, however, these debates have since died down. I feel that these tragic events are reason enough to finally reopen the discussion.

As a first year student, I have long been frustrated with the way support for first years is provided. To be blunt, ""RLMs"" are useless. As individuals, I am sure that they are caring people who want to do whatever they can to support first years, and so I do not wish to indict anybody individually here, they are not at fault. However, as an institution they are completely ineffective. I have maybe seen my RLMs once or twice throughout the year, and that was during frosh when they essentially were just there to herd us like preschoolers into Tomlinson Fieldhouse for us to play some ""orientation games"". I have not seen them since. Barely involved in social media activities or even to try and visibly organize events beyond the occasional poster, I don't believe anybody I know knows who their RLMs are or where to see them. They stand aloof from us and yet we're supposed to turn to them for support in a crisis.

This brings me to my next issue: their complete inaccessibility. The whole point of having a Floor Fellow or an RA in general is to have someone who is readily accessible for support whenever students need them. The fact that they are only accessible via office hours, which for the record are barely advertised, is frankly nonsensical. If I or someone else, struggling with the burdens of first year and, for many, the first time being away from home, is feeling suicidal, what we need is immediate support from someone that can be trusted. Instead, what we get is needing to navigate a confusing bureaucracy only to have the only support available be someone that is effectively a stranger in an office who will meet you at 3:00 PM on a Tuesday in two weeks. Because it makes sense for the suicidal ideations of an isolated first year to be treated as equivalent to a mundane question about the syllabus. And what about students with pre-existing or emerging health issues? The bureaucracy of both the Student Wellness Hub and the Quebec healthcare system for someone not from Quebec would be enough to make Kafka blush. What is there for students who need help navigating this system or require easily accessible support?

I am thankful to be surrounded by supportive friends and people who would be there for me if ever a crisis arose. But many do not have this luxury. Many first year students have few or even no friends at McGill. This may be the first time they've ever left home. They may not be confident in their English or in French, resulting in further feelings of alienation at McGill. This may be their first time exposed to alcohol or drugs, and it being possibly their only way of finally feeling accepted in their new home, they may push themselves far beyond their limits. And the only people there to help them if that happens are a bunch of severely drunk freshman who probably could not give less of a shit about their wellbeing.

To die, just as one is entering the world, with hopes and dreams for what your life could be that will never be realized, is tragic. I don't know this person, and I will reiterate that I will not speculate on how they died out of respect for themselves, their friends, and their family. Maybe having Floor Fellows could not have prevented these things from happening. Regardless of the circumstances, may they rest in peace, and I hope those closest to them may find peace and healing. Nonetheless, these events are concerning in light of the overarching fact that first years are falling through the cracks at McGill, not by accident or by lack of funding, but by a conscious decision to eliminate a vital service to provide immediate support for vulnerable first years. And I think the most damning fact about all of this is that all that the university could provide in light of yesterday's events for students possibly now dealing with the trauma of witnessing what had transpired were a singular Resident Life Manager only accessible from the hours of 10 to 4 and a link to a help line.

I believe it is necessary to petition the university to make change, to reinstitute Floor Fellows and to offer further support and resources for students that could actually make a difference in their lives, rather than placing them in the hands of distant administrators. As an individual, I cannot do much, and I am unfamiliar with how to petition the university or the SSMU. But I can't stand around and say nothing. McGill, in their efforts to cut corners, has put the lives of countless first years at risk. This cannot continue.

Food: 

Ticket prices were over $200 and froshies were only given food at some events. Where they were, the portions were small (especially before or after a day of drinking) and they weren't told they could take seconds. Froshies were not told when they would be given food and what the food was. Also, the gluten free and dairy free options felt like an afterthought. For brunch one day, the gluten free options provided was one orange and a tiny pack of chocolate covered cranberries, while everyone else had bagels with cream cheese. The coords didn't seem to know if the non-meat options were vegan/ dairy free. The options were not clearly marked and it seemed like they were guessing.

Transportation: 

Transportation was not free and most of the events were pretty far away. A $200 ticket should come with a week long metro pass. Drivesafe was advertised as a reliable option, but when it didn't work, coords told staff and froshies to avoid drive safe as they were severely uinderstaffed. There was a significant 'not my problem' attitude when it came to transportation. A lot of froshies are kids who don't know the city and aren't used to public transportation, it's not fair to expect them to know what transportation options work or don't. 

Alcohol: 

Frosh is notorious for being a rowdy event where alcohol is served but it should not be labeled an orientation. It is basically a drinking week. There were no campus tours or events close to campus. There was a movie night in which arts students were told to go to McMed (a science building, not even an arts building.) These kids aren't even familiar with the campus yet but they're going into a week of drinking 3 days before classes start. Any event with alcohol becomes about alcohol at frosh. There were chugging games (organized by the coords) when during training we were told to NEVER encourage chugging. The whole week revolved around alcohol, not seeing campus or the city, or making friends. There was little opportunity for people to talk because most events were at loud clubs.

Accessibility and Inclusivity: 

There was little accommodation for froshies that don't drink. If frosh is a drinking week, it should be advertised as such. People showed up regretting spending so much on a ticket just to watch people drink till they're drunk. There should have been two events at the same time, one with alcohol and one without as not everyone wants to be in that environment. It should not be assumed that everyone is going to drink, therefore nonalcoholic options should be available and advertised. At the bar crawl, people were given 10 minutes to play one chugging drinking game with either water or beer and then made to move to the next bar. 

Golden Rule: 

The golden rule for frosh is that you can't have a sexual or intimate relationship with a froshie as a member of staff. However, one of the events was 'tarps off' (shirtless) which immediately created a sexual environment. All leader-froshie interactions were now in the grey area of the golden rule. Dancing together clothed in a club vs shirtless at an outdoor concert has very different implications.

UBC's values emphasize equity and inclusion, which I fully support. I would like to engage, and be part of this effort, but I’m afraid to. This is **not** a far-right post purporting to support free speech but actually advocating for bigotry - I don't identify with those perspectives at all and I believe they are very harmful. Rather, I consider myself fairly liberal, but I get the impression that I'm not always ""liberal enough"" to freely express my views at UBC and that, if I do, my career might be negatively impacted. (I’m posting this with some trepidation and am grateful for the anonymity.) This post, then, is about my worry that the university's approach to these issues might be backfiring: by being too forceful, we are shutting down debates and making many potential allies feel alienated and unsafe about expressing their views. And we really need these allies on board championing equity and inclusion.

As a concrete example, I've been thinking a lot about the [recent events surrounding UBC's board chair](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/michael-korenberg-resigns-ubc-1.5621268). (Note: I don't have any extra information here beyond what I've seen in the news.) My impression is that this person was not a good fit for the job and UBC is better off finding someone whose values are better aligned with the university's values. Truly, I can't understand why someone in that position would show up to a meeting wearing a MAGA hat or go around liking those tweets - both because I can't understand supporting those causes and because it seems obvious that these actions would be inflammatory. However, I'm not sure it was appropriate to completely throw this person under the bus; to me at least, it sends a message (true or not) that conservative views are not tolerated at UBC and one's tenure at UBC may not outlive one's expression of these views. And I am being literal here - I am a bit troubled and actually *not sure* how to handle such situations - that is not a euphemism for disagreement. In my state of being unsure, some discussion would be great. Unfortunately, I’m worried that expressing any view other than ""good riddance!""  might lead to trouble for me. I have heard several stories about folks being shamed or intensely criticized for expressing the ""wrong"" views. (Am I exaggerating about this trouble? I am basing these worries on my own observations, but still, maybe this is all in my head, or maybe I’m particularly sensitive or risk-averse. So I should add a reminder that all this is just one person’s perspective.) 

A problem with keeping quiet is that, across a broad range of issues, my inner mental state and what I would need to say in public are drifting apart. From talking to others, I think this is very common at UBC. Here is what I've observed: outwardly, most people follow the party line, and so it looks like we're doing well at promoting equity and inclusion. But in reality, from what I can gather based on private conversations, peoples' inner thoughts vary widely. I've heard about extreme cases where people post something on social media and then, in private, say the exact opposite. In the short term, this system works: things are getting better because some bad behaviour is genuinely being eliminated. But I don't think this is going to work long term if we're fostering a fear-fuelled theatre of tolerance rather than actual tolerance. This really worries me.

Part of the reason I feel unsafe engaging in these issues is that it's not at all clear to me what is OK and what is not OK at UBC. Some things are obvious: bigotry is not tolerated and should not be tolerated. But some things are very muddy and nuanced. For example, it seems that supporting the current U.S. administration is not permitted (see above) and that criticizing the current U.S. administration is fine. However, criticizing some other countries' governments is actually not OK (I have been told), because it can lead to folks (e.g. international students) from those countries feeling unwelcome and can fan the flames of xenophobia. Perhaps there are some other governments beyond the U.S. that we can openly criticize - I don't know. It feels like there's a set of unwritten rules of what is/isn’t ""allowed"" at UBC, but nobody has told me the rules. And if these rules are hard for me, as someone who has been around here for a while, I can only imagine what it would be like for the new folks joining UBC each year, especially from other countries or cultures. It feels like we're inviting people into a minefield of these unwritten rules - sort of like inviting someone to a dinner party without telling them about the dress code. My goal here is not to criticize these rules; in fact, many of them make sense to me. But rather, my concern is that the rules are really complicated and haven't been clearly communicated - and that the consequences for violating the rules can sometimes be serious. This is a bad combination that stokes my fear of engaging in conversation. 

From my standpoint as a faculty member, I have some thoughts on how we might improve the situation. I suggest trying to bridge the gap between different views, by engaging each other in conversation rather than shutting people down or shaming them. When we hear true intolerance, we need to stop it in its tracks. When we hear questions about process, or why things are a certain way, or genuine struggles with inclusion -- in other words good faith discussion and engagement -- a safety net is needed; this type of engagement should not put one's reputation at risk. 

I think this messaging needs to come from the top. Even one message from a high-up UBC authority could make me feel a lot more safe and accepted. Something along the lines of, ""We expect everyone at UBC to act according to our UBC Code of Conduct [or equivalent document], and this is non-negotiable. This won't be easy for everyone, and that's OK. We understand that different members of the UBC community will have different perspectives, and we welcome discussion on these difficult issues. We don't have all the answers and we, the UBC leadership, may benefit from talking to you as much as you would benefit from talking to us."" The idea here is to combine clarity (link to Code of Conduct), firmness (it's non-negotiable), understanding (this won't be easy for everyone, and that's OK), and some humility (we're doing our best, but we don't have all the answers). 

I think UBC's Equity & Inclusion Office also plays an important role here. In my limited interactions with this office, it is staffed by extremely professional, competent, liberal individuals. What about finding some conservative-leaning staff or running some workshops about the struggles to embrace UBC's worldview for folks coming from very different perspectives? To me at least that would be so powerful, and very inclusive; it would show that conservative folks aren't by default considered bad people, and that even if some of their values don't align with UBC's values, we still want to talk to them. Second, in the various equity and inclusion workshops and training sessions offered for faculty, I would add in the opportunity to challenge the prevailing views. From what I've seen, these workshops are often framed as showing us the ""correct"" way to act and to be. I don't think that works. There are a lot of really sensitive issues at play here - for example, should we consider a person's gender or race when hiring faculty or admitting students - and if so, how? I think these issues are too difficult to be solved without discussion. 

Once again, I am not trying to argue for ""anything goes"" free speech or downsizing our efforts toward a more equitable and inclusive campus. Rather, I'm arguing for realigning our efforts on this front to engage people more genuinely. If I can't express my doubts, nobody will know to address them, and they will linger or fester. I suspect there's a large untapped resource of people at UBC who, like me, want to do more but are disengaging out of fear, frustration, or disillusionment. I would love to open myself up as an ally for UBC's values without fear of a misstep.

-----

**Update**: thank you for all the discussion. I learned a lot from reading the responses and reflecting. This was more or less my first time engaging in a discussion like this outside of private conversations. 

I did not realize students were aware of Michael Korenberg and his views while he was in office, though this seems obvious in hindsight. I hadn't heard of him until he resigned and I saw the news, which likely made it more jarring for me. I feel more at ease about this now. As mentioned in one of my replies below, I would still advocate for some accompanying wording about how career repercussions for political views are reserved for extreme cases (and I'm on board with this being a legitimate extreme case). It's hard to know how much to generalize from myself to others, but I suspect such a sentiment might put a lot of people at ease.

Another follow-up thought is that it seems like one's personal and professional personas are increasingly merged. For example, I know many academics for whom Twitter is a crucial tool to their career development. I don't know any academics who have separate personal and professional social media identities though. And even if they did, people at work could find their personal accounts. I think this complicates matters, because the realms of public and private are increasingly blurred. I don't have any suggestions for what to do about it.

Thanks for the references to the [paradox of tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance). I had heard of it but not engaged with it as much in the past as now. I support being intolerant of intolerance. My lingering concern is that it's very hard to know where the line is, beyond which something is considered intolerance at UBC. As discussed in my post, sometimes it's obvious (e.g. some of the views Korenberg liked on Twitter) but sometimes I feel it's quite tricky. From what I can gather, the boundary depends not just on the message, but also the medium, the context, the person’s role, and probably more. For example, what if the UBC Board Chair had a sign on their front lawn supporting a Conservative candidate before an election? What about a faculty member expressing doubt, at a faculty meeting, about whether certain pro-inclusion practices are effective? It seems like those should be OK, right? It's all very tricky.

Finally, my post focussed mostly on feeling afraid and unsafe, but I should admit to feeling some frustration as well. Personally, I feel I've grown a lot from being at UBC - first learning about equity and inclusion issues, and more recently trying to stand up for equity and inclusion when opportunities arise.

you’d think an elite school like this would have good professors who speak english clearly, optimal facilities and proper aid but NOPE. it’s all for show. they just want to keep their rank up and be as a “tough, hard to get into” school for no fucking reason. 

I wish someone had clearly laid this out for me back when i got my offers. There is honestly no reason for anyone going to this school for undergrad since bachelors are basically useless and grad school only cares about ur GPA.

I wanted to share this article in hopes of highlighting provincial legislation (Bill 96) that I think could seriously harm the ability for Anglophone students in Montreal to access government services (as well as having certain restricted rights that are supposed to be guaranteed by the Canadian constitution):[https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/hanes-the-devil-is-in-the-details-of-bill-96-and-they-are-alarming](https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/hanes-the-devil-is-in-the-details-of-bill-96-and-they-are-alarming)

Namely: 

\-  Large numbers of allophones and other linguistic minorities could be stripped of the ability to communicate with the government in English. 

\-  Quebec civil servants could face disciplinary measures if they speak or communicate in English with citizens deemed ineligible.

\-  There are no guarantees ensuring emergency services like 911 or Urgences-Santé ambulances would continue to be offered in English. 

\-  The elimination of knowledge of English as a criterion for selecting judges and no requirement for judges to speak English in Quebec court houses.

I am wondering if anyone knows any additional groups/organizations that are looking to fight Bill 96, or if other students are in any way concerned about this and how it might impact them?","['legaut', 'think', 'he', 'cool', 'trudeau', 'senior', 'he', 'gon', 'na', 'say', 'watch', 'whatever']",,0.3182,legaut think he cool trudeau senior he gon na say watch whatever

38078,i get the sentiment but whats wrong with being a capitalist,"I think the demeaning of the importance of humanities is leading to a narrow minded, unhappy society.",2020-05-04 13:44:41,UofT,Discussion,"Now let me preface this by saying that stem and humanities rely on each other. Without one, the other would lose so much importance. I think other college kids would agree that STEM is being pushed to the forefront and that earning money and being “useful” is all that matters. I will say that there’s a much more practical application and clear progression toward jobs and financial security than if you majored in humanities. I think that’s due to lack of job training and clear cut options given to students, and a problem that needs to be addressed. But so many people are unfulfilled and unhappy because our values and culture and core characteristics of humanity are being dismissed or neglected. There’s a reason so many people resonate with quotes, media, books, etc. it’s because they allow us to understand what we value and how to work towards and live by those values. But what’s being enforced through education and imposed on the youth is something that is noble in intention, but misguided to say the least. The value isn’t being conveyed, and thus people with poor values are ruining our world. It’s no coincidence, don’t you think?

Humanities aren’t useless. They’re essential. They enrich our lives and help us understand more about the world in a different, but just as valid, way than stem. If you really think about it, what STEM achieves to do literally STEM’s (Sorry) from the humanities. They inspire curiosity, hope, dreams, and a way forward. Progress.

Lots of kids I know are miserable because their lives aren’t enriched by the humanities and they’re told that STEM fields are the only fields that matter and making money is of the utmost importance. If you can sell yourself and you’re good at what you do, it doesn’t matter what you major in. So yes, it may be easier to BS your way through a humanities degree, but understanding it at the highest level is nothing to scoff at. Something I think people should strive to achieve outside of their work, if their work is STEM related.

Let me be clear. I’m not saying one is better than the other. But great things are achieved when multiple different types people work together to create something amazing. Now arguing about what is best and what is “right.” I’m a computer science major myself, but I encourage all of you students to study literature, film, philosophy, whatever interests/enriches you life. Because being well-rounded and understanding reasoning and examining our history is how we do not repeat mistakes. It’s how we decide the best way to use our technological, medicinal, and other practical advancements. Without humanities is no way to live. Without STEM, people don’t get the opportunity to live. Both are amazing. Just know whatever you choose to study isn’t the end all be all. And don’t be cornered into studying something that doesn’t interest you just because it’s what you’re “supposed” to do. I truly believe that so many of our problems are due to people who have expertise in a skill but don’t examine or question the morality or validity of it all. I think there’s a Socrates quote related to this, but I’m blanking right now. Imagine working your 9-5 and coming home and not having a form of entertainment. Understand why those are meaningful to you. Just because it’s not understood to many, doesn’t mean it’s unimportant.

Tl;DR: don’t demean other fields and disciplines. They’re all important. Learn, read, write, and go on a lifelong quest for doing something good that fulfills you, while also considering practicality. Jobs run on practical application, but knowing how to sell yourself and communicate is essential.","['get', 'sentiment', 'whats', 'wrong', 'capitalist']",,-0.631,get sentiment whats wrong capitalist

96042,ragan is the goat if he taught every class the school would be a better place,PSA: To my fellow McGillians,2020-07-15 08:03:34,McGill,,"I cant express enough exactly how important this is...but if any Professor ever brags about how difficult their class is, or how hard it is for you to get a good grade in their class, then please for the benefit of yourself and your sanity drop that class. 

No educator should be proud of being bad at conveying information or simply designing something that their students are bound to fail at. We pay thousands and thousands of dollars, spend an ample amount of time back and forth juggling our finances, social life as well as education, pull all-nighters relentlessly just to do well. And if all of this effort literally goes into the bin because some entitled fuck claims that their class is impossible to do well in, then they don’t even deserve to be in that institution. The point of doing well isn’t to create something that’s insanely difficult for a student to excel in, there is nothing to be proud of if you’re causing someone mental trauma from the course material and then prizing your course for “being so difficult” as if it’s some trophy on display to take pride in. 

Therefore, PLEASE find a professor that actually wants you to pass & genuinely cares about your well being. Some of these folks don’t actually care about you, your performance, your degree or your well being - they’re out here to make it all the more difficult for u, for no particular reason.

All students and recent graduates (2019) will receive $1250\month if making less than $1000\month.,2020-04-22 15:34:15,UofT,Finances,"This was just announced by the government. 

Read about it here:

https://beta.ctvnews.ca/national/canada/2020/4/22/1_4906564.html

It will run from May to August 2020.

The total cost of this welfare program will be $9B.

The Government will also double the Canada Student Grant by $3000. 

Edit:

#FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:

*I preface this FAQ by saying that details are evolving as we go, and this program is not official legislation. The program may change in the final legislative draft and law. This is based on the information that has been released so far on April 22nd, 2020.*

**Who qualifies?**

Based on government sources, you qualify if:

(a) You are a student that will return to school in the Fall of 2020, or

(b) You have graduated, or will graduate in 2020.

and will make less than $1000/month from the months of May to August.

**Can international students apply for this benefit?**

CTV News reports:

>The new funds will be available for Canadians studying in Canada, as well as students who are completing postsecondary schooling abroad, her office clarified. Non-citizens, such as international students, cannot claim the emergency benefit.

Permanent Residents are, however, reportedly eligible.

**Can high school students going into university apply for this benefit?**

There are no firm details on this yet. Some journalists (CBC) are saying that incoming first-year students will qualify.

**Can part-time students apply for this benefit?**

Yes, part-time students can apply.

**How much is the monthly benefit?**

The monthly benefit is $1250/month for eligible students, and $1750/month for students with disabilities or eligible dependents. It will run from May 2020 to August 2020.

**Where do I go to register/apply for this benefit?**

There are no firm details yet. However, the government has said this benefit will be administered through the CRA. This likely means one way to apply will be via the online My CRA account. You can register for a My CRA account [here.](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html) 

**When can I apply for this benefit?**

The program is still not official law. Therefore, the government does not have the program ready yet. Expect to hear more details on when you can apply in early May. In the meantime, make sure you have a My CRA account.

**Do I need to have had a job lined up for the summer to qualify?**

No, you don't need to have had a job or lost your job. If you are a post-secondary student, you can apply.

**Can I still work and apply for this benefit?**

Yes, you can still work and receive the benefit provided that you do not make more than $1000/month.

**What if I am earning a stipend or working via NSERC this summer?** 

This is still unclear. There are no firm details. It will all depend on the definition of ""income"" in the legislation. It may only include employment and/or business income (like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit), and not other forms of non-taxable income like scholarships, stipends or research grants.

**Do I have to have worked last year in the summer to get the benefit?**

No, there is no current 2019 income threshold or work requirement to get this benefit.

**I collect $2,000 a month from the CERB. Can I also collect this benefit?**

No. You either claim the CERB or the CESB, but not both in the same time period.","['honestly', 'great', 'basically', 'bleeding', 'money', 'year', 'planning', 'working', 'month', 'school', 'year', 'program', 'month', 'afford', 'rent', 'come', 'september', 'alone', 'might', 'cover', 'fucking', 'love', 'canadian', 'god', 'bless']",,0.9467,honestly great basically bleeding money year planning working month school year program month afford rent come september alone might cover fucking love canadian god bless

basically, these 3 douche guys have been in the back of this class fucking around all semester. they've been not wearing masks, talking, watching videos with sound on together, and openly making discriminatory comments about Kathy's lectures. people have heard them making comments about transgendered people, women, and calling a child in a video we watched who was born addicted to meth a ""gimp"". obviously that's fucked up, so lots of people all semester have been complaining about them to our prof. she's noticed as well, so today when they tried to sneak out early, she stopped in the middle of the class to walk up to them and demand them for their school ID's so she can report them for nonacademic misconduct. they all beefed it in the back of CIRS 1250 literally in the middle of lecture in front of the whole class :')

6367,international organizations have deemed hamass health ministry numbers as accurate for the longest time of course its hard to count your dead amongst all the rubble so the un revised the figures even then almost thousand dead children strikes a pretty grim picture and should be an indictment towards the idf heck we even got footage of war crimes committed by the idf you are willfully turning a blind eye to all of this in order to defend a military incursion that has had little regard for the lives of unarmed civilians and children even if you want to ignore all footage of unarmed civilians and children going out and about who were murdered by the idf amongst them the hostages you claim to be concerned about youd still be hit with the realization that you do not shoot a human shield the international community has long been telling the israel to minimize civilian casualties but i guess they simply dont care enough,"As promised, I strolled through Kings College and this is what it looked like",2024-05-23 17:39:51,UofT,Discussion,"Just want to start by saying that I don’t remotely belong to either cultural group. I was born in Toronto and have had the privilege of a life without civil war. My only stake in this situation is that I was a student during the fall/winter semester when the conflict started hitting headlines and I’ll be graduating in June. I’ll be observing the people who will be protesting on convocation day alongside my peers, who have all been pretty quiet about this topic. This post is for the people who are curious to know what their graduation ceremony is going to look like if its at the convocation hall next week.

The impression I got from this encampment was this: it was quiet, there wasnt anybody blocking doors to the adjacent buildings, and there wasnt really an air of chaos that has been exaggerated on insta. Its peaceful. It was just asian tourists visiting the campus for their kids and people going to and from class. There is an entrance to the encampment thats being guarded by a handful of people, but not much human activity. Of the 6 whole protestors I saw, it wasnt exactly a mixed group, but my sample size is too low to really confirm anything. No they were not wearing masks or trying to conceal their identity. Unfortunately it smells like weed and other things you could guess would come from an encampment, but thats to be expected. In contrast, there was a lot of construction going on and contractors working all around the encampment. I feel a little bad. That whole stretch of park has no shade so I wager its hot as hell in there.

So no, Kings College isnt a warzone, and you can go about convocation without feeling unsafe. There are a number of places where you can take decent pictures without getting tents in the background. Nobody is blocking doors and going after eachother.

One person on this reddit said that uoft put the fence up to deliberately stop the anticipation of a protest, but after visiting today I think that’s just bs. 🤦‍♀️ I counted at least 3 other sites that were fenced off for construction and landscaping all around the circle. Plus, the work that is being prepared for the circle was no different from the construction on Robarts and Woodsworth. Its ironic that this same fence is now being used as a barrier preventing contractors, or really anybody, from entering the park. I did not try to enter this checkpoint thing, and I’m aware that other journalists have attempted to do this with varying results.

I finally formed an opinion on this. I think it’s great that people are practicing their freedom of expression. You should be allowed to advocate for vulnerable groups without getting shot by cops. While I think the war/crimes against humanity is awful, I actually don’t really support the encampment and their demands. Literally every facet of our country has had a direct and indirect involvement in supporting warfare beyond our borders. So even if they were to succeed in getting UofT to stop being involved with companies like Hebrew University of Jerusalem(??), or the Daughters for Life Foundation (?????) I honestly dont believe the unrelenting warfare in the middle east-east asia will ever really end. Children will still die at the same rate, relief workers will still die, genocides are still going to be funded by Canadian corpos, families will still face tragedy, and the isms will continue onward because nobody can agree on how the borders should be redrawn. 

A brief crash course on the history of Israel in my undergrad still feels true to me. I know that is my oblivious privilege talking, but this is all I see before me. There are so many problems in the world and I only have the energy for the ones happening here on this side of the globe. The fentanyl epidemic, the children who make up the majority of clients in Canadian foodbanks, the unaffordability of life as we know it, and the isolated elderly populace here in the GTA have my full attention. 

I’m at peace with the protest and I wish the protesters well. If they get UofT to yield to their demands, that is awesome and I’ll applaud their efforts. I hope other people find their peace with this too.

They've been to Save-On, Sharetea, other areas on campus and Wesbrook village and are now quarantining. I am extremely worried as this means that more than likely, everyone at these frat parties have been exposed to COVID and likely have it.

My friend also disclosed to me that many of the guys at the frats have been tested and are choosing to keep their diagnosis secret so they can attend Imagine UBC and the rest of their courses.

Their professors are not allowing them to have online accommodations, forcing them to either miss important coursework or come to class with COVID.

7823,its starts small nazi party had rallys on the street which seems like nothing but it added up,This subreddit is secretly controlled by the Chinese communist party and here is PROOF,2020-07-22 23:16:32,UofT,Meta,"Hello everyone, please hear me out. 

I’m highly confident the subreddit mods are being backed by the Chinese Communist Party. I’ve spent the last two months investigating on and off, digging through the r/UofT subreddit, including beyond when most of us were here and I discovered some highly suspicious findings. 

For starters, I’ve discovered that in 2017, Reddit released a new process for removing moderators on the website. You can see the original announcement by the Reddit admins here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/65xcya/omg\_its\_here\_new\_process\_for\_removing\_moderators/](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/65xcya/omg_its_here_new_process_for_removing_moderators/) 

It was soon after that there was a new group of moderators who managed to take over the subreddit. The original creator of the subreddit is now no longer the same top mod and the rest of the moderators were all added shortly afterwards.

Now all within this preceding time, it has also been widely exposed in mainstream media that there is foreign influence from China at universities, typically through student groups and local Chinese state-backed organizations. This has been a big problem at Australian universities with pro-Beijing protests breaking out. And recently in Canada as well, going as far as having some of the influence being direct connections to or support from China's Consulate General. 

Some news articles:

Now given all this, it would not be a stretch at all to suggest that it’s possible there are state-backed actors are behind the U of T subreddit. We've seen it happen with the Russians on Twitter and Facebook, it's only a matter of time Reddit gets hit. I'm surprised the media isn't looking more into this yet. 

Just as a very simple example, if you do a subreddit search of anti-CCP phrases on this subreddit - such as in support of Hong Kong like 'free hong kong', you’ll find almost no results whatsoever. 

https://preview.redd.it/35koy6soqhc51.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=81d51017ccfc28818d8d60278abe3e56631d8513

In contrast, other university subreddits like r/uwaterloo or r/berkeley have multiple occurrences of this phrase show up in their search, such as is common on university subreddits with socially and politically active university students.

You will notice the same trend for mentions of ""Xi Jinping"" and “CCP”. 

Also, a manual inspection of several controversial posts from this subreddit regarding China, you will also find many removed or deleted comments, presumably ones negative about the Chinese government, as only moderate sounding comments remain.","['start', 'small', 'nazi', 'party', 'rally', 'street', 'seems', 'like', 'nothing', 'added']",,0.3818,start small nazi party rally street seems like nothing added

As a someone who lives in Montreal, if McGill were to open in the fall, we would risk transmission within our own community and within the **entire** downtown core of the city, including all the major transport areas and where most of the city's homeless population lives and sleeps.

It is normal to be super disappointed about losing certain university experiences and having classes done remotely, but as an entire community, we are potentially saving *lives. LOTS of lives.* How much more concrete ""positive social action"" could we get? If taking a class online could potentially spare someone from going to the ER room or losing a loved one, I am kinda all in.

We have no actually idea what the risk of transmission is or would be if we had people come back to campus. We have ideas and theories - but realistically, I don't think we actually know. Can you imagine what would happen if we *did* go on campus and a bunch of people got sick, or even potentially died? How would McGill look then?

Does anyone feel like we are losing sight of this? I dunno, maybe I am just trying to see the bigger picture and maybe I am just protective, but I am hoping there are some of you out there that understand. ","['agree', 'right', 'thing', 'still', 'suck']",,-0.3612,agree right thing still suck
69877,i agree with this the left are like the riots in the us currently bring bombs and guns to an argument of words,I'm afraid to speak my mind at UBC,2020-08-04 17:09:12,UBC,Discussion,"Hi all, I'm writing to express my perspective as a UBC faculty member on talking about politically charged ideas on campus. UBC's values emphasize equity and inclusion, which I fully support. I would like to engage, and be part of this effort, but I’m afraid to. This is **not** a far-right post purporting to support free speech but actually advocating for bigotry - I don't identify with those perspectives at all and I believe they are very harmful. Rather, I consider myself fairly liberal, but I get the impression that I'm not always ""liberal enough"" to freely express my views at UBC and that, if I do, my career might be negatively impacted. (I’m posting this with some trepidation and am grateful for the anonymity.) This post, then, is about my worry that the university's approach to these issues might be backfiring: by being too forceful, we are shutting down debates and making many potential allies feel alienated and unsafe about expressing their views. And we really need these allies on board championing equity and inclusion.

As a concrete example, I've been thinking a lot about the [recent events surrounding UBC's board chair](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/michael-korenberg-resigns-ubc-1.5621268). (Note: I don't have any extra information here beyond what I've seen in the news.) My impression is that this person was not a good fit for the job and UBC is better off finding someone whose values are better aligned with the university's values. Truly, I can't understand why someone in that position would show up to a meeting wearing a MAGA hat or go around liking those tweets - both because I can't understand supporting those causes and because it seems obvious that these actions would be inflammatory. However, I'm not sure it was appropriate to completely throw this person under the bus; to me at least, it sends a message (true or not) that conservative views are not tolerated at UBC and one's tenure at UBC may not outlive one's expression of these views. And I am being literal here - I am a bit troubled and actually *not sure* how to handle such situations - that is not a euphemism for disagreement. In my state of being unsure, some discussion would be great. Unfortunately, I’m worried that expressing any view other than ""good riddance!""  might lead to trouble for me. I have heard several stories about folks being shamed or intensely criticized for expressing the ""wrong"" views. (Am I exaggerating about this trouble? I am basing these worries on my own observations, but still, maybe this is all in my head, or maybe I’m particularly sensitive or risk-averse. So I should add a reminder that all this is just one person’s perspective.) 

A problem with keeping quiet is that, across a broad range of issues, my inner mental state and what I would need to say in public are drifting apart. From talking to others, I think this is very common at UBC. Here is what I've observed: outwardly, most people follow the party line, and so it looks like we're doing well at promoting equity and inclusion. But in reality, from what I can gather based on private conversations, peoples' inner thoughts vary widely. I've heard about extreme cases where people post something on social media and then, in private, say the exact opposite. In the short term, this system works: things are getting better because some bad behaviour is genuinely being eliminated. But I don't think this is going to work long term if we're fostering a fear-fuelled theatre of tolerance rather than actual tolerance. This really worries me.

Part of the reason I feel unsafe engaging in these issues is that it's not at all clear to me what is OK and what is not OK at UBC. Some things are obvious: bigotry is not tolerated and should not be tolerated. But some things are very muddy and nuanced. For example, it seems that supporting the current U.S. administration is not permitted (see above) and that criticizing the current U.S. administration is fine. However, criticizing some other countries' governments is actually not OK (I have been told), because it can lead to folks (e.g. international students) from those countries feeling unwelcome and can fan the flames of xenophobia. Perhaps there are some other governments beyond the U.S. that we can openly criticize - I don't know. It feels like there's a set of unwritten rules of what is/isn’t ""allowed"" at UBC, but nobody has told me the rules. And if these rules are hard for me, as someone who has been around here for a while, I can only imagine what it would be like for the new folks joining UBC each year, especially from other countries or cultures. It feels like we're inviting people into a minefield of these unwritten rules - sort of like inviting someone to a dinner party without telling them about the dress code. My goal here is not to criticize these rules; in fact, many of them make sense to me. But rather, my concern is that the rules are really complicated and haven't been clearly communicated - and that the consequences for violating the rules can sometimes be serious. This is a bad combination that stokes my fear of engaging in conversation. 

From my standpoint as a faculty member, I have some thoughts on how we might improve the situation. I suggest trying to bridge the gap between different views, by engaging each other in conversation rather than shutting people down or shaming them. When we hear true intolerance, we need to stop it in its tracks. When we hear questions about process, or why things are a certain way, or genuine struggles with inclusion -- in other words good faith discussion and engagement -- a safety net is needed; this type of engagement should not put one's reputation at risk. 

I think this messaging needs to come from the top. Even one message from a high-up UBC authority could make me feel a lot more safe and accepted. Something along the lines of, ""We expect everyone at UBC to act according to our UBC Code of Conduct [or equivalent document], and this is non-negotiable. This won't be easy for everyone, and that's OK. We understand that different members of the UBC community will have different perspectives, and we welcome discussion on these difficult issues. We don't have all the answers and we, the UBC leadership, may benefit from talking to you as much as you would benefit from talking to us."" The idea here is to combine clarity (link to Code of Conduct), firmness (it's non-negotiable), understanding (this won't be easy for everyone, and that's OK), and some humility (we're doing our best, but we don't have all the answers). 

I think UBC's Equity & Inclusion Office also plays an important role here. In my limited interactions with this office, it is staffed by extremely professional, competent, liberal individuals. What about finding some conservative-leaning staff or running some workshops about the struggles to embrace UBC's worldview for folks coming from very different perspectives? To me at least that would be so powerful, and very inclusive; it would show that conservative folks aren't by default considered bad people, and that even if some of their values don't align with UBC's values, we still want to talk to them. Second, in the various equity and inclusion workshops and training sessions offered for faculty, I would add in the opportunity to challenge the prevailing views. From what I've seen, these workshops are often framed as showing us the ""correct"" way to act and to be. I don't think that works. There are a lot of really sensitive issues at play here - for example, should we consider a person's gender or race when hiring faculty or admitting students - and if so, how? I think these issues are too difficult to be solved without discussion. 

Once again, I am not trying to argue for ""anything goes"" free speech or downsizing our efforts toward a more equitable and inclusive campus. Rather, I'm arguing for realigning our efforts on this front to engage people more genuinely. If I can't express my doubts, nobody will know to address them, and they will linger or fester. I suspect there's a large untapped resource of people at UBC who, like me, want to do more but are disengaging out of fear, frustration, or disillusionment. I would love to open myself up as an ally for UBC's values without fear of a misstep.

-----

**Update**: thank you for all the discussion. I learned a lot from reading the responses and reflecting. This was more or less my first time engaging in a discussion like this outside of private conversations. 

I did not realize students were aware of Michael Korenberg and his views while he was in office, though this seems obvious in hindsight. I hadn't heard of him until he resigned and I saw the news, which likely made it more jarring for me. I feel more at ease about this now. As mentioned in one of my replies below, I would still advocate for some accompanying wording about how career repercussions for political views are reserved for extreme cases (and I'm on board with this being a legitimate extreme case). It's hard to know how much to generalize from myself to others, but I suspect such a sentiment might put a lot of people at ease.

Another follow-up thought is that it seems like one's personal and professional personas are increasingly merged. For example, I know many academics for whom Twitter is a crucial tool to their career development. I don't know any academics who have separate personal and professional social media identities though. And even if they did, people at work could find their personal accounts. I think this complicates matters, because the realms of public and private are increasingly blurred. I don't have any suggestions for what to do about it.

Thanks for the references to the [paradox of tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance). I had heard of it but not engaged with it as much in the past as now. I support being intolerant of intolerance. My lingering concern is that it's very hard to know where the line is, beyond which something is considered intolerance at UBC. As discussed in my post, sometimes it's obvious (e.g. some of the views Korenberg liked on Twitter) but sometimes I feel it's quite tricky. From what I can gather, the boundary depends not just on the message, but also the medium, the context, the person’s role, and probably more. For example, what if the UBC Board Chair had a sign on their front lawn supporting a Conservative candidate before an election? What about a faculty member expressing doubt, at a faculty meeting, about whether certain pro-inclusion practices are effective? It seems like those should be OK, right? It's all very tricky.

Finally, my post focussed mostly on feeling afraid and unsafe, but I should admit to feeling some frustration as well. Personally, I feel I've grown a lot from being at UBC - first learning about equity and inclusion issues, and more recently trying to stand up for equity and inclusion when opportunities arise. But I still don't fully feel a sense of belonging at UBC. When I have doubts about these types of issues, I feel my concerns are unwelcome. Hard to say if this is caused by my own issues vs. the culture at UBC, though. In any case, this conversation has diminished my frustration somewhat, so thanks again.","['agree', 'left', 'like', 'riot', 'u', 'currently', 'bring', 'bomb', 'gun', 'argument', 'word']",,-0.2023,agree left like riot u currently bring bomb gun argument word

There were no chairs left for me at his seat, so I did what I always did in highschool. I sat on his lap. Its funny bc he needs me to fix his code but at the same time I am able to use my weight(I am a skinny fat, I look skinny but I’m dense) so I crush him and hes in pain. 

This whole time she's just staring at me, I look over and smile and she smiles back. Me thinking she found it funny, but she didn’t I guess.

17911,i feel like this isnt truei lived at innis for three years and the front desk is pretty good at knowing whos who and will question a stranger for id you also need a key to get to the elevator and the laundry rooms are locked behind a keyfob too edit oop yeah the innis part is definitely a lieunless things have changed drastically in the last years innis laundry is coinoperated too,My life as a Homeless student at U of T. -- a guide.,2022-11-15 03:58:28,UofT,Finances,"INTRO: I am not poor or broke or nothing. I just refuse to tolerate this shitty capitalist Toronto housing market. I’ve been living and studying rent free for the last 3 months since the last minute lease I was trying to get fell through. When classes started I figured I’d try and figure out how to live in robarts while I found housing, but since then it has become a lifestyle that is pretty satisfying tbh, and allows me to save a lot of money.

Sleeping: I sleep at Robarts commons, on the armchairs on the fifth floor (If you’ve been there at 3AM you’ve probably seen me sleeping in the front area with all the armchairs and the wierd desk chair things). You can gather the pillows from the common sitting area for elevated sleep experince. I keep a blanket in my backpack at all times. It keeps me warm against the cold in literal weather sense and metaphorically against the cold UofTears culture.

Clothing and cleanliness: I have a locker at the AC, which didn’t cost me anything because I found 2 day lockers and just slapped a lock on it. I keep my clothes in there, as well as a bar of soap, my toothbrush and toothpaste, deoderant, and a towel. I shower there every morning after my workout (its bulking season my dudes).

I wash my clothes at student residences, I just slip in with my laundry bag behind some clueless first years and just act natural. Usually I try to sneak into Innis or trin, but not New College, as they require a fob for the laundry room. I don’t go to woodsworth because they have coin operated that you have to pay for, not worth my toonie.

Leisure: Like a lot of u of t students, I don’t have much of a social life. I have a couple of friends who I’ll study with sometimes, and occasionally I crash at their places (if we’ve been drinking or smthn). For fun, I practice piano in Hart House, feed the squirrels in the UC quad, and scroll through reddit.

Mental Health: Parts of this lifestyle is kinda depressing, and U of T is pretty stressful as is. Not gunna lie, I spend some time crying, and try to cope through watching anime. Schools meant to be stressful i guess, and I figure there’s only a year and a half left in my schooling, I can hold out till then. I try to cope with my depression by going on regular walks through Queens park and Scholar’s walk. It really helps.

Family: My parents don’t really know about this, and tbh, they don’t ask, I just told them that I rent a place off of Bloor for cheap. What they don’t know wont hurt them. I think my older brother suspects that something isn’t quite right: I had to be really cagey last time he passed through the city, told him my place was being deep cleaned for roaches. But I don’t think he’ll tell them, he’s pretty busy, and not a nosy dude in general.

Food: Because I’m spending money on rent, I can actually afford good healthy food. This helps me stay healthy, (probably healthier than you reading this). I snack on PB&J and baby carrots since bread and peanut butter don’t need to be refrigerated (I buy a new bag of baby carrots almost every day). I know a first year at New who occasionally lets me use his meal plan. I also eat out regularly since I can now afford it since I don’t pay rent. 40$ hot pot every sunday? Hell ya — I could pretty much do it every day with my savings!

Conclusion: I recognize that this probably isn’t the life for everyone, but it’s worked really well for me thus far. I’m not at university to live out some type of “college experience”, I’m just here to get my degree and hopefully a good paying job when I graduate. I’m going to graduate debt free, and I’ll have enough savings stashed away to almost put a down payment on a house (I’m hoping prices crash before I graduate). I hope this guide helps anyone who like me, are just tryna get through university as fast as possible, and move on to better things, without struggling with this overpriced city’s rental market.","['feel', 'like', 'isnt', 'truei', 'lived', 'innis', 'three', 'year', 'front', 'desk', 'pretty', 'good', 'knowing', 'who', 'question', 'stranger', 'id', 'also', 'need', 'key', 'get', 'elevator', 'laundry', 'room', 'locked', 'behind', 'keyfob', 'edit', 'oop', 'yeah', 'innis', 'part', 'definitely', 'lieunless', 'thing', 'changed', 'drastically', 'last', 'year', 'innis', 'laundry', 'coinoperated']",,0.91,feel like isnt truei lived innis three year front desk pretty good knowing who question stranger id also need key get elevator laundry room locked behind keyfob edit oop yeah innis part definitely lieunless thing changed drastically last year innis laundry coinoperated

27363,ikr i am feeling okay thanks for asking we can get through this stay healthy hope this chaos will end soon,I got harassed for wearing a mask today,2020-05-13 05:02:17,UofT,Discussion,"I’ve been a long time lurker and I never thought I’d post anything on reddit but I feel the need to talk about what happened today. 

I was around Yonge/Wellesley area today to do some errands (pick up dog food and grocery shop) and while I was walking home, a Caucasian person decided to follow me along the way and harass me for wearing a mask. (For background, I’m Asian, Korean to be more specific) This person started to talk to me about how masks are useless and why I am wearing them... and then proceeded to call me stupid. This person would berate me, pause, walk a bit forward, then as I walk up to her again, she would start ranting again. I wanted to think that this person would just rant a bit and just go away but this went on for two more blocks. I didn’t want to interact with her so I just ignored her. I also carried a 4kg bag of dog food plus two big bags of groceries so my hands were preoccupied. But as I approached the entrance of my condo, she ran up to me (she was already way ahead waiting for me) and attempted to kick me. Luckily I didn’t get hurt, she kicked my groceries. But at this point, I just yelled “What the fuck is your problem?!” And she just went away. 

I felt really angry when I got home. Called my parents/friends and talked about it. I was angry that she targeted me and tbh, also really disappointed no one attempted to intervene. This didn’t happen in the middle of the night. It happened around 4pm on Yonge street in plain daylight. Other people were wearing masks too, and as this person just harassed me, people just staring at me. Though I don’t blame anyone, I’m sad that everyone just stared at me. I wish I could’ve retaliated but my hands were full and I didn’t want to give my attention to this person so I kept on ignoring her. Which, in retrospect, I kind of regret. 

I felt more angry in the beginning but now I’m feeling a lot more scared/anxious. I feel like it’s scary to go outside now. I walked my dog tonight and I saw a glimpse of someone walking along Yonge st and I freaked out and just ran back inside. Maybe I’m overreacting right now but I’m pretty rattled. 

I’m just really stunned that this happened to me, just for wearing a mask. To me, a mask does not just protects me but protects everyone so I’m also just surprised at the ignorance. I realize many asians are being targeted and that’s really not okay. I understand every one is going through hardships and maybe the person who harassed me had been going through some tough shit. It’s understandable to be frustrated but that should not be a justification to mistreat anyone. 

I just felt like posting this, maybe as a cathartic release because I still feel light-chested.

31241,take a screenshot of your acorn as proof and email it to anyone important i feel like thats your strongest piece of leverage,My lovely stats exam,2019-12-19 21:13:05,UofT,Discussion,"So I had a stats exam yesterday and essentially, ACORN gave me the wrong location. 

It was weird however since everything was going fine and dandy while I was writing the exam until two hours had passed. Right when they announced there was an hour left, the prof came up to me and told me to stop writing.

I asked him why and he then only told me I was in the wrong exam room. TWO HOURS AFTER. I asked him what I could do and he said I should run to the other exam location (btw it was 20 min away). I told him if I did that, I would have less than an hour to complete a three-hour exam and I would fail (the final was worth 60% of my grade). 

I begged him for me to just let me complete this exam and then he just pulled me aside and yelled at me.  I felt so hopeless. They weren’t even trying to help me out. I kept asking what I could do and they were essentially saying “take the 0.”

Now I had to defer my exam but it’s just so messed up. Instead of helping me or instead of figuring out that I was in the wrong location after they came around for signatures in the beginning of the exam, they left me in the dust.

72276,thank you for your kind words,"I was assaulted by a man on the SkyTrain this morning, looking for witnesses",2024-01-16 00:39:12,UBC,Discussion,"Disclaimer - I only added race descriptions as a visual description in case a witness viewed the event.

Hi. I'm sorry to be writing today, I'm really distressed and panicking.

At around 12:10PM on the way to Olympic Village station, I (19F asian girl wearing glasses) was assaulted by an elderly caucasian man (60-70s) holding a striped cane today on the Canada Line. I was sitting on a seat in the front section of the train nearest to the door next to the aisle and listening to music with my noise-cancelling headphones. At around Broadway station the man got on the train, came up to me, and hit me with his cane and demanded I get up from my seat, yelling “GET UP!”. I always make sure to give my seat to the elderly and pregnant, but in this case I refused to reward the man’s behaviour for bullying me and hitting me, and since the seat I was sitting in was not an elderly-priority seat.

I was angry and wanted to stand up for the future victims, wondering how many times this man got away with this. So instead of getting up from my seat I told him ""No, this seat is not elderly seating, I'm not obligated to give my seat to you"", but he hit me harder again with his cane. He yelled at me and kept repeating “get up right now”, hitting me again as I kept saying no. Then he started elbowing me hard in the ribs and I could try to tell he was trying his hardest to hurt me.

Then a big middle-aged Caucasian man holding a beer got up. I first thought he was going to stand up for me, but instead, he yelled at me for not giving up my seat saying it was disrespectful. I could tell he was probably drunk and he was carrying a beer. Then, the young South Asian guy sitting next to me defended me and agreed that I'm not obligated to give up my seat. However, another middle-aged Caucasian woman joined in, defending the elderly man. The drunk man kept yelling at me and got closer yelling that he “witnessed it” when I said I was going to call the police.

I was afraid I was going to get punched or injured since he was drunk so I got out of the train trying to de-escalate the situation, but I’m infuriated at myself how I didn’t ask for any witnesses’ contact info, I didn't even check the train number, I froze up and didn't do anything. I think I had my first panic attack. I was so stupid and ignorant and didn’t do anything. Most of all, I’m really upset that no one except the South Asian guy stood up for me and just watched me get hit and let them gang up on me. I feel so helpless and without support. Now I realize I was stupid and should've given up my seat, if i just complied this would've been avoided. I doubt the police can do anything, and I’m afraid to go on transit again.

I beg any witnesses who viewed this incident to come forward. I already reported it to the transit police, but I need witnesses to make this case go through. If you know anyone who took the Canada Line going to Waterfront this morning please please please come forward. Thank you

I am a PhD student at UBC and I get a stipend of around $2000 per month. My rent is $1300 and my monthly groceries are $400. Add to this the health insurance of $75, the phone bill of $50, and the freakin' coin laundry bill of $20. I am a human too so I go out on some weekends and let's add a miscellaneous budget of $100 per month. All of this totals to $1945.

So am I saving $55 a month? Heck no! I need to pay the tuition fee which averages to $500 a month. There you go, I am cashflow negative, let alone saving peanuts.

The point of this post is to get an idea of how other grad students at UBC are staying afloat. If you are a grad student, please share your story here. If you are an undergrad who is willing to pursue a PhD, DO NOT apply to UBC, just apply to universities in the US or EU.

I'm an CS student. Just finishing up my final year and have a job offer making $135K as a programmer a prestigious tech company.

Every time I go to a bar, party, or any social event in general, I try my best to avoid telling people what I do.

Every time I tell women I'm a CS student they start hitting on me.

Last week I went to a friend's birthday party. Told his sister I was a CS major. She kept asking me to ""debug her code"" and ""reverse her linked list"" in a flirtatious manner.

This is a reoccurring problem. It's gotten so bad that I tell women I ""make websites"" so they will stop hitting on me all the time.

Any advice on how to stop attracting so many women as a CS student?","['go', 'back', 'dressing', 'acting', 'like', 'man']",,0.3612,go back dressing acting like man

I just refuse to tolerate this shitty capitalist Toronto housing market. I’ve been living and studying rent free for the last 3 months since the last minute lease I was trying to get fell through. When classes started I figured I’d try and figure out how to live in robarts while I found housing, but since then it has become a lifestyle that is pretty satisfying tbh, and allows me to save a lot of money.

Sleeping: I sleep at Robarts commons, on the armchairs on the fifth floor (If you’ve been there at 3AM you’ve probably seen me sleeping in the front area with all the armchairs and the wierd desk chair things). You can gather the pillows from the common sitting area for elevated sleep experince. I keep a blanket in my backpack at all times. It keeps me warm against the cold in literal weather sense and metaphorically against the cold UofTears culture.

Clothing and cleanliness: I have a locker at the AC, which didn’t cost me anything because I found 2 day lockers and just slapped a lock on it. I keep my clothes in there, as well as a bar of soap, my toothbrush and toothpaste, deoderant, and a towel. I shower there every morning after my workout (its bulking season my dudes).

I wash my clothes at student residences, I just slip in with my laundry bag behind some clueless first years and just act natural. Usually I try to sneak into Innis or trin, but not New College, as they require a fob for the laundry room. I don’t go to woodsworth because they have coin operated that you have to pay for, not worth my toonie.

Leisure: Like a lot of u of t students, I don’t have much of a social life. I have a couple of friends who I’ll study with sometimes, and occasionally I crash at their places (if we’ve been drinking or smthn). For fun, I practice piano in Hart House, feed the squirrels in the UC quad, and scroll through reddit.

Mental Health: Parts of this lifestyle is kinda depressing, and U of T is pretty stressful as is. Not gunna lie, I spend some time crying, and try to cope through watching anime. Schools meant to be stressful i guess, and I figure there’s only a year and a half left in my schooling, I can hold out till then. I try to cope with my depression by going on regular walks through Queens park and Scholar’s walk. It really helps.

Family: My parents don’t really know about this, and tbh, they don’t ask, I just told them that I rent a place off of Bloor for cheap. What they don’t know wont hurt them. I think my older brother suspects that something isn’t quite right: I had to be really cagey last time he passed through the city, told him my place was being deep cleaned for roaches. But I don’t think he’ll tell them, he’s pretty busy, and not a nosy dude in general.

Food: Because I’m spending money on rent, I can actually afford good healthy food. This helps me stay healthy, (probably healthier than you reading this). I snack on PB&J and baby carrots since bread and peanut butter don’t need to be refrigerated (I buy a new bag of baby carrots almost every day). I know a first year at New who occasionally lets me use his meal plan. I also eat out regularly since I can now afford it since I don’t pay rent. 40$ hot pot every sunday? Hell ya — I could pretty much do it every day with my savings!

Conclusion: I recognize that this probably isn’t the life for everyone, but it’s worked really well for me thus far. I’m not at university to live out some type of “college experience”, I’m just here to get my degree and hopefully a good paying job when I graduate. I’m going to graduate debt free, and I’ll have enough savings stashed away to almost put a down payment on a house (I’m hoping prices crash before I graduate). I hope this guide helps anyone who like me, are just tryna get through university as fast as possible, and move on to better things, without struggling with this overpriced city’s rental market.","['flex', 'guy', 'respect', 'ability', 'live', 'within', 'margin', 'read', 'like', 'vids', 'yters', 'go', 'homeless', 'experience', 'though', 'sort', 'spiritual', 'experience', 'human', 'experience', 'youre', 'urban', 'planning', 'student', 'uh', 'unplanning', 'self', 'subscribe', 'im', 'surprised', 'dont', 'understand', 'resiliency', 'case', 'resourcefulness', 'behind', 'student', 'behaviour', 'read', 'yet', 'another', 'example', 'canary', 'coal', 'mine', 'scenario', 'many', 'young', 'people', 'especially', 'agencyseeking', 'person', 'grappling', 'desiring', 'participate', 'established', 'society', 'dont', 'understand', 'axiom', 'unplanning']",,0.8316,flex guy respect ability live within margin read like vids yters go homeless experience though sort spiritual experience human experience youre urban planning student uh unplanning self subscribe im surprised dont understand resiliency case resourcefulness behind student behaviour read yet another example canary coal mine scenario many young people especially agencyseeking person grappling desiring participate established society dont understand axiom unplanning

>Dear all,
>
At today’s Faculty of Science Town Hall it was announced that McGill plans to roll out - as much as possible -l in-person, on-campus teaching activities starting in January 2021.
>
Chairs have been asked to submit a list of teachable courses, to be finalized by Tuesday next week.
>
After a pre-screening with associate deans we have assessed the courses highlighted in yellow (table below) as potentially and partially teachable on campus. This assessment was targeting courses in the intermediate enrollment range (about 20-100). Larger courses should check if some elements (e.g., tutorials) might be offered on campus.
>
This is a very sudden development and probably unexpected with the background of the extended red alert situation in the Montreal region.

Edit: This was an email sent to the profs and graduate students in order to gauge the mood and plan the list to send to the faculty.

I have ADHD and I’m dyslexic. My reading comprehension is fine but I’m so incredibly slow at reading that I scored in the 7th percentile when tested. For those of you who don’t know what that means, just know that it’s really, really bad. 

I’m in a field that’s super reading heavy. It only works out cuz I spend 3-4x (likely more tbh) the amount of time on my readings as other students. I’m usually able to handle this but recently I just couldn’t. I couldn’t keep my eyes on the page. I couldn’t stop my train of thoughts. I was failing to recognize simple words and I had 7 other things I also needed to get done. Ultimately, I just wasn’t able to do it within a timeframe that came anywhere close to reasonable and, one whole month later, I finally fucking read all the damn readings and picked the one I wanted. 

I didn’t think I was going to get any sympathy for this. I fully expected (and deserved) to lose marks but despite being super anxious I somehow managed to actually send my prof the damn email yesterday. 

I told him about how my ADHD and dyslexia have been making it really hard for me to, well, read. I threw in some self deprecation and several apologies. I fully prepped myself to get written off/penalized. Instead, I got the nicest possible reply and it warmed my heart. 

This prof had voluntarily given me an extension for a different assignment I didn’t even ask for (but definitely needed), told me not to worry about this in the future and communicate my issues instead, and asked me if there was anything else he could do to help me.

Who does that? I ghosted for a month but was given a free extension anyway and then he offered to do even more!? It’s nice to see that this kind of tolerance exists and at a university level. 

There’s been a lot of frustrated rants on here lately (understandably) and I thought my actually good prof experience might help spread some of the happiness I got out of it.","['bish', 'im', 'also', 'adhd', 'dyslexic', 'severe', 'deficiency', 'th', 'percentile', 'processing', 'speed', 'th', 'percentile', 'working', 'memory', 'relatable', 'first', 'time', 'ive', 'heard', 'someone', 'else', 'struggling', 'multiple', 'deficiency', 'mcgill', 'interested', 'wan', 'na', 'form', 'chat', 'would', 'nice', 'finally', 'talk', 'someone', 'know', 'like', 'lol']",,0.6597,bish im also adhd dyslexic severe deficiency th percentile processing speed th percentile working memory relatable first time ive heard someone else struggling multiple deficiency mcgill interested wan na form chat would nice finally talk someone know like lol
101174,i never realized how foreign all of this lore would be to incoming students thats actually really funny like we are multiple levels deep at this point,The year is 2026,2024-07-26 14:52:59,McGill,,"The war for campus rages on. The SSMU Vice-President for War has recently signed a defense pact with the New Encampment Junta against Supreme Leader Saini. Multiple faculties now stand in ruins due to the constant shelling. After the March Rebellion, the entirety of the Law Faculty was exterminated by Sainist forces.

I head to campus for my morning lecture. At the first checkpoint, an armed guard scans my forearm - we all got a barcode tattooed on us last year. I wait 20 minutes at the border checkpoint for the secondary pat-down and K9 check for bombs, trying to ignore the grad student loudly dying of tuberculosis in front of me. After the patdown, I then have to cross 4 more military checkpoints to make it to my lecture - how dehumanizing!

Armed guards stand at the front of the lecture hall ready to shoot the professor the second he makes an anti-Sainist comment. Today, only 2 suicide bombers interrupted the lecture, so I actually got to learn some material. After the lecture, I go to study at the library with my one friend; gatherings of more than 2 were banned earlier this year. I walk past all of the empty shelves where now-censored books once stood, not that anybody is allowed to check out books anymore.

Suddenly, we hear the air raid siren. The New Encampment Junta must be launching a new wave of rockets towards campus. We drop everything to run to the closest bomb shelter where the Cyberthèque once was. We're stopped at the entrance of the shelter, another checkpoint. At this point, I think I've heard ""Can I see your ID?"" more than any other sentence in my life.

Suddenly, an image flashes into my head - my ID, at the table in the library, left behind. The guard pushes me away from the bomb shelter. ""The bomb shelters are for McGill students and staff only,"" he yells. Defeated, I go to sit on the grass near where Rodick Gate once stood, as I watch the rockets streak through the sky.

Thank you for all the unexpected interactions this got! 

Many of you agreed with what I was saying, and some didn’t. This post mentions some things to do to be heard by those “representing” us and talks about the shady past some of you brought up:

https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/112oibt/student_support_fee/

—

I just read my email and found that the services that we got this year, grammarly udemy and calm, are being removed? This really annoyed me, its been months of me using it and thought it would be here till the end of my degree. The fee was more than worth it for what we got in return.

Does anyone know why SMMU Council decided not to give us the services again? Literally me and everyone I know is using atleast one of the services if not more. Udemy and grammarly are huge life savors, they helped me prepare for class much better than ever before. Even calm I began to use regularly to help me sleep.

It just seems weird that they these services came and went so quickly? I am sure I am not the only one who has built some sort of dependency on the service.

I just wish we at least have the option to use the services and not it being taken away from our hands just like that. Is there anything we can do to keep Student Support and their services?

Watch SMMU then introduce it later on for a higher price without Student Support. There is a clear demand for this, as I said every student I know is using atleast one of these services

On the first day there were people standing outside of the classroom asking us to join a WeChat group chat that’s consisted of students. I was like ok that sounds good maybe I can ask general questions there so I joined. The next morning I woke up and found several people adding me and told me they’re my classmates and would like to make friends with me, again I think it’s fine even though I don’t socialize so I just said yes and left them there in my contact list. 

We never talked, and then recently, to be more specific this week, at different times, they all sent me the exact same message asking me if I need help in homework/quiz/exam. At first I just blocked them all but tonight after receiving this message for the fifth time I got annoyed and asked them what it is. They told me that they can do hw/quiz/exam for me as long as I pay them, and I can even customize the grade. I asked them why aren’t they afraid of getting caught and they told me that there are colluded teacher in uoft and that they have professional team to deal with these problems. That’s insane, I don’t know if that’s true but the fact that they said it and send those messages to a random person like me is crazy. 

I literally just got back home from school after spending 13 hours at school continuously studying my ass off and this happened. These cheaters make me mad asf

Here’s the translation of the message: 

- hii babe need help with homework/quiz/exam?The recent price is very nice! You can also guarantee high score to! Let yourself be the best one! Free consultation. Feel free to contact me at any time to arrange.

What’s this? Pay you to do exam?

- yep you can think so

Didn’t you say you’re a student?

- I am, but I’m also doing international study service

Aren’t you afraid of getting caught and being kicked out?

- Nope they won’t find out. I won’t be doing this if they could. 

Why? Nobody reported you?

- Because we have a professional team here. Plus, as long as you’re not telling this to others no one will know. 

So you’re saying even if you get reported, you can still get rid of that?

- That will count as a complaint. It surely can be dealt. After all, there are professional staff doing this as well.

You mean staff inside U of T?

- Our professional team contact teachers in the school to resolve complaints. Which means directly to the teachers at this school.

So you’re saying that there are teachers colluded?

- you can understand so

From which department? The one that specifically deal with ao?

- Yep

27942,sorry to hear that a while back a guy on the street asked me for direction too he seemed really confused even though what i said was not complicated at all but nothing happened afterwards,Recommendation to all students (esp female) do NOT speak to anybody who approaches you on the street,2022-02-08 14:27:37,UofT,Advice,"Moved dt for in person classes and literally on my first day back I walk outside my building and get stopped by a man asking for directions, while I'm pointing he suddenly bends down and runs his hand down my buttocks and leg (happened around spadina/bloor).

I'm planning to report the incident but because I don't have strong identifying information idk if it'll help, so I'm writing this here hoping that other innocent students living in dt toronto for the first time don't have to encounter this.

I've had another incident recently where somebody asked for directions, then asked for my number and followed me down the street once I refused and tried to walk away.

I used to apologize for not having cash to homeless people begging for money until somebody started yelling racial slurs at me.

And a few other cases of people approaching me on the street and asking to smile etc.

So basically when you're walking dt, doesn't matter where or when or what the person looks like, unless you recognize them, don't even make eye contact and just walk by quickly. It might go against instincts and feel rude but I feel stupid for not knowing better.

On the other hand if you witness a serious street harassment incident if you do stop, maybe ask the victim if they're ok. A few people saw the person touch me and they stopped for a second but then just kept going.

102653,bruh,Do Not Rent Thread 2020,2020-04-24 22:36:39,McGill,HQ Post,"Hi all,

I assume I'm not the only one worrying about where I am going to live next year. Since the pandemic makes it impossible for us to tour any apartments in person, I thought I would start a thread so that we can warn each other about apathetic landlords and (hopefully) save each other from a lot of trouble. I'll go first:

&#x200B;

DO NOT RENT FROM 1575 AVENUE SUMMERHILL

Yes, I know it is in a wonderful location. That is, in fact, the only redeeming quality of this building. Here is a list of all the crap my roommates and I have had to go through in the past 15 months:

1) When we visited the complex in February 2019, we were not allowed to visit our specific unit because it was being renovated. Instead, all visitors were allowed to see the same ""showroom"" (first red flag).  When we moved in, our unit looked quite different from the showroom and was halfway underground. 

2) Right after we moved in, there was loud construction in the unit directly above us starting at 6:30am (like, not just the construction itself but also yelling and blasting rock music). We contacted our landlord multiple times about it. Each time she said she would talk to the constructions workers; nevertheless the early morning noise continued. Also, random water shutoffs for \~4 hours at a time which we get no notice for. Management denied these shutoffs were happening. 

2) A couple weeks after moving in, the construction workers cut one of the water lines in the unit above ours, causing our ceiling to flood, the fire alarm to go off, and raw sewage to leak from our ceiling, damaging some of our valuables. They compensated us with $20 Starbucks gift cards and said the damage ""wasn't serious enough"" for any more compensation. 

3) Since our unit was newly renovated, it was not recognized as an official address (and STILL IS NOT to this day, technically). This created problems with getting wifi and Hydro-Quebec set up (we actually still don't have a Hydro-Quebec account, even though we contacted them multiple times about it). 

4) There is absolutely no security at the front door, and the construction workers often prop the door (which is usually locked) open. Once as I was heading to class in the morning there was a homeless man sleeping at the bottom of the stairs. 

5) In early September, the company that owned the building (University Apartments) sold the building and there was a sudden change of management. Because the new company (COGEIM) did not have online banking set up at the time, we had to walk all the way to their office at 1450 Rene Levesque to pay rent IN CASH every month. They eventually set up online banking for 4 banks, of which my bank was not included.

6) After the change of management, we learned the person who had managed the ""emergency number"" for University Apartments was living in the Philippines. So if I were theoretically stuck in the elevator, I would be calling someone halfway across the world. lol

7) The cockroaches. Oh, the cockroaches. Thank God we didn't have bedbugs like some of the other units, but the cockroaches were everywhere. In the cabinets. In the bathtub. In my printer. INSIDE THE TABLE (somehow). We had to have our apartment sprayed 4 times during the Fall, and each time required us taking literally everything out of every cabinet and setting it in the middle of the apartment. Not a fun time during midterms, especially when they gave us 24h notice.

8) The heating system is very outdated and doesn't work properly. Our apartment was always about 3C too warm. Other units had no heating at all, even when it was -18C out. There are older people living in our building. They could have died. 

9) The false fire alarms. There were 4 of them in one weekend once (thankfully the weather wasn't too cold at this point). The fire department got pissed at COGEIM and told them they needed to fix the alarm system. So they did. The next morning. And didn't tell us that they would be coming in to our units to fix it. So we woke up one Tuesday morning at 9am hearing 2 men talking in our living room. My roommate went and talked to them, and they said it was an ""emergency"" and that they didn't need our permission to come in to fix our fire alarms. Then they laughed at us for still being asleep at 9am on a weekday. 

10) One of the sinks the construction workers used on the third floor became backed up, causing untreated water to flood parts of the third AND SECOND floors. It took multiple days of many people calling the emergency number for anyone to respond. 

11) Now the juiciest part: the bathroom construction. Everyone in the building got a notice 6 days in advance (we are legally supposed to get 10 days notice) that construction workers would be coming into our bathrooms, tearing out the walls and ceiling and removing the vanities. This was because the renovations University Apartments had done were purely for aesthetic value and they had ignored that the plumbing needed to be replaced. The notice said this construction would last ""7-8 business days"". Well, the construction workers forced themselves into our unit 1 day before they were supposed to because they ""were ahead of schedule"" (some other units they came in 4+ days earlier than planned). Despite being ""ahead of schedule"", we had no vanity, ceilings or walls in our bathroom for over a month. I could see the unit above me when I was in the shower. She could see me. It was awkward. The dust/asbestos coming out of our bathroom walls gave everyone in my apartment breathing problems. In fact, EVERY UNIT in the building had a bathroom like this for over a month. Then the pandemic started and they ceased construction, leaving the bathrooms the way they were (I was able to come back home to get away from all this mess thankfully, but I know a lot of people don't have that privilege and are still living in those conditions). 

12) Many people in the building decided to go on a rent strike for April, myself included. We filed multiple complaints with the Regie and sent COGEIM multiple warning emails before April 1st and received no response from management. We finally got an email yesterday (which addressed my roommates and me by misspelled versions of our names) from COGEIM reminding us that we haven't paid our April rent and threatening us with going to the Regie if we don't pay. Well, looks like we'll see you in court, COGEIM. 

In short, avoid this building at all costs.",['bruh'],,0.0,bruh

Hello future McGillians! We know that you have lots of questions, and we're here to help answer them. To keep the subreddit orderly, all that we ask is that you restrict discussion to this megathread. All other posts will be removed.

Before you comment, please **read the FAQs below**, and note that administrative inquires about requirements, deadlines, financial aid, etc. are best directed to [Service Point](https://www.mcgill.ca/servicepoint).

You might also try asking your question [here](http://ask.mcgill.ca/) on the McGill website.

**What are my chances of getting in? When will I receive a decision?**

We aren't admissions officers, so we can't tell you anything beyond the general rule that offers are made in waves, based on grades and test scores, until all available spaces are filled. This means that the higher you are above the [minimum requirements](https://www.mcgill.ca/applying/requirements) for your program, the better your odds of acceptance, and the [sooner you're likely to hear back](https://www.mcgill.ca/applying/nextsteps/decision).

However, simply being above the minimum requirements is not a guarantee of admission.

**If I don't meet the requirements for the program I want, can I get into another program and then transfer?**

Transferring into most programs is a lot harder than getting admitted to them in the first place, so while this is a possible route to take, it's a big risk as you would have to substantially improve your academic performance in your first year.

**What if I'm accepted with my predicted grades or scores, but then they go down a little?**

As long as you pass all of your classes and graduate from your current high school or CEGEP, you'll be fine.

**Is McGill better than this other university? Is a McGill degree good for jobs?**

Most of us haven't attended any other universities or been in the labour market for very long, so we probably can't give you an informed opinion.

**How hard is it to get a high GPA at McGill? I've heard there's grade deflation.**

It's hard—McGill will not hold your hand—but it's also perfectly possible to graduate with a high GPA if you take courses that interest you and manage your time efficiently. In other words, your perception of difficulty will vary based on your program and your academic background, such as how good the study skills you developed in high school are.

Different faculties and departments have different policies when it comes to forcibly curving a class's grades down so that there's a certain average (also known as ""grade deflation"").

**What is student life like?**

Lots and lots has already been said about this topic. [Read through some past threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/search?q=student+life+-flair%3ASSMU&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) to get some ideas.

Broadly speaking, being in the midst of a city as fun and affordable as Montreal, socializing tends to happen off-campus. There is a visible party culture, so if that's up your alley you will probably find it easier to make friends. However, with 27,000 undergraduates and hundreds of clubs, there is a niche for everyone. You may just have to look a little harder to find yours.

Of course, a big part of life in Montreal is dealing with winter. Seasonal depression is real, so consider your ability to tolerate five months of overcast days with 4 pm sunsets, freezing temperatures (sometimes as low as -30° C with wind chill), and occasional icy sidewalks that make getting to class downright hazardous.

**Do I need to speak French to come to McGill?**

No. Montreal is a relatively bilingual city, so you can spend four years here and get by without a word of French. However, your life will be much easier and more opportunities will be available to you if you can speak—or make an effort to learn—un peu de français.

**I've accepted my offer! What next?**

**This is a user-requested megathread for all questions related to residences housing in Montreal as McGill transitions to in-person activities for the Fall.**

We will have this megathread pinned until we have something else we need to pin, and if it's very popular we'll keep it pinned longer. We might also close it during finals and then open a new one for the summer with answered Q&As based on the comments in this one, and eventual announcements from McGill.

Anyway, have fun and best of luck to everyone with their return to Montreal (or continued existence within the city for people who haven't left)!

It can be extremely unsafe to work with anonymous apartment postings and we encourage you to use website in which some form of identity verification is possible.

63540,jfc thats terrible maybe they wouldve sent someone if we told them someone was parked in a non parking zone or speeding smh,Got followed from No Frills at Alma onto the bus to campus,2021-06-07 03:40:46,UBC,Discussion,"Hey guys, just putting this out there so you guys can be a little vigilant. I was doing groceries today at around 1:30pm at No Frills by Alma street and I was waiting for the bus back to campus around 2pm. After waiting alone for like 15 odd minutes a random middle-aged man comes like **really** **close** to me and starts asking really creepy and personal questions even though I was wearing my earphones.

He immediately started asking me:

""You take summer class?""  
""What class do you take?""  
""You headed to UBC?""  
""When does summer school end?""  
""When does **your** summer semester end?""  
""Can you help me check when does the summer semester end?""

But the one thing that made me extremely uncomfortable was this exchange:

Him: ""What bus are you taking?""  
Me: ""The number 4.""  
Him: ""I'll take it with you I'm heading to UBC too""

Like by this time I was already extremely freaked out because he never said hi, never introduced himself, I was by myself. Either way, this was a complete stranger. The number 4 comes around eventually and I thought of to skip it and wait for the 84 since I thought, okay he's heading to UBC too. But then he asks me if I was taking the number 4? I said I was gonna skip and take the express (to avoid him). And he doesn't get into the bus!! So I bolted into the number 4 to see if he was going to follow me and he did!! I told the bus driver he was following me and he said to stop at the next stop and see if he follows.

I sit in the number 4 at the back of the bus and he follows suit and sits **directly next to me,** and like, there is still a *pandemic* going on?? Like there were a plethora of empty seats why didn't he just sit somewhere else?? I immediately get up and stand by the door and call my friend then 911. We eventually make it to the bus loop while I was on the phone making the report to 911. I think he noticed because I repeatedly said ""I think I'm being followed"" on the phone. He leaves the bus without me and starts walking towards the book store.

I also eventually left a report with RCMP because they followed up but in case anyone needs a description of this man:

* Caucasian male, mid 40s to 50s
* Skinny build, about 6ft tall
* Balding head (kinda looks like Mr. Burns from Simpsons)
* Slanted (kinda sinister-looking) eyebrows
* Crooked, yellow teeth
* Was wearing a dark grey parka, red scarf, red trousers, dark brown/ashy boots

He wasn't carrying any weapons but damn, was that a creepy experience...

37644,what year are you in freshmen,Reported for an Academic Offense: my experience and tips,2021-01-28 19:08:01,UofT,Academics,"Don't cheat. Don't cheat. Don't CHEAT!!!

With that established, let's now move on to the fun stuff. I decided to make this post because I've been seeing a lot of posts from students reported for an academic offense. But I have yet to see someone who's been through the full process share their story and experience, so that's exactly what imma do now. Beware, this will be a long ass post cause I have a few things I want to address. 

**What was I reported for?**

Collaborating with other students on one question of a final exam.

**My penalty?**

A warning and a grade reduction (it was a first offence).

**How long did it take for the AO to be resolved?**

This really depends on your faculty. For me, from start to finish, it took less than a month but I'm also in eng and AOs seem to get resolved quicker here. I've heard artsci and Rotman are taking at least 2-3 months these days. 

# THE PROCESS 

\*This isn't a guarantee that all AOs will progress in the same way. I'll link a great thread written by another student that outlines the full process at the bottom of this post. 

**Step 1: Email from Professor**

* Professor emails me to schedule a meeting to discuss a possible AO on my final.

**Step 2: Meeting with Professor + Chair's Designate**

* This happened on the same day I received the email \[lasted about 20 minutes\].
* He showed me the parts that were flagged and why they were suspicious. Asked if I wanted to make a confession (at this point, I did not, though I would advise anyone to come clean as early as possible). 
* Since it was a final, my prof said this case would be going straight to the Dean's office.
* Overall, this step ""introduced"" me to the ""charges"" against me (lol sorry).

**Step 3: Email from Dean's Office**

* I got an email saying my meeting with the Dean's Office was scheduled for two weeks later (I received this email around 10 days after my meeting with my professor).

**Step 4:** **Meeting with the Dean (Dean's Designate technically)**

This is where I started to find there was very little information.

* The meeting lasted approx. 15 minutes. Your professor and department chair are invited to this meeting, though neither of them were present in mine. 
* The Dean said there was strong evidence I had committed an AO. He went over possible sanctions for what I did, briefly mentioned sanctions for repeat offenses, then asked if I had anything to say.
* I confessed and apologised (keep it short and simple).
* The Dean accepted my confession and apology, then spent the next 10 minutes convincing me that this was not the end of the world, I was a good student and I would recover from this :)
   * Ngl he said beautiful things that honestly made me wanna cry mid-meeting (Such a nice man and I wish only good things for him <3)

# My Experience

I'll start off by saying that this honestly depends on what you did and what your professor/faculty are like, but I had a very positive experience. It was incredibly stressful waiting everything out, but everyone was very nice. My professor, though disappointed obviously, never once made me feel like I was a terrible person. The Dean's designate especially (I love this man) continuously said that mistakes happen, that he understood the temptations during online school are tough, and that he never wants to destroy student's success. He was very happy that I confessed right away and that I was to the point and apologetic (can't stress this enough, you need to show you're sorry!!!). 

# Tips

* Confess early, take responsibility for your actions, apologise, and DON'T CHEAT AGAIN!!!!
* Don't make up excuses (thanks to the ppl on my previous post)
* Should you mention factors that may have affected your judgement (health, mental health, family issues, etc.)?
   * First offence? No (unless it's something crazy extreme). You're already looking at one of the lighter penalties, so there's no point bringing anything up because it won't help. 
   * If it's a serious or repeat offence, then you can briefly mention any factors that were affecting you at the time to show it was a lapse in judgement. But be sure to add that this doesn't absolve you from guilt and that you take full responsibility for not going about it the proper way. 
      * Also mention ways in which you'll prevent this from happening (ie. filing petitions, getting accommodation, etc.) to show that you've learned from this experience.
* Don't be a brat. This goes without saying, if you show that you're humble and apologetic, they will be kind to you.

# Takeaways

Don't cheat!!!!! Seriously. It's not worth it. Not only is it a terrible stress on you, but it's unfair to your professor. I feel sad I even did this to my professor because he's a very nice man.

Professors, TAs, faculty members, most of these people HATE having to do this. Contrary to popular belief (at least in my experience), these people don't take explicit joy in punishing you. They WANT to see you succeed. 

# My Own Thoughts

I'm going to end this post with some of my own thoughts. First off, you are not a terrible person if you cheated. Did you do something bad? Yes. Do you deserve a sanction? Yes. But that's all it is, a sanction. There are some miserable people on this sub and at uoft who will make you feel like you committed a federal crime and that you'll get expelled.  

If the dean, prof and chair all recognise that students make mistakes, then why on earth do some of you miserable redditors feel the need to make offencers feel like unforgivable people? Am I saying that you should coddle students who committed an AO, say shit like ""ooooh it's okay, so sorry you're in this position :(((("" ? Absolutely not. But trying to scare students by writing extreme possibilities and taking joy out of their stress? That's a shitty thing to do. Be better. If you don't have anything useful to say, or if you don't want to support a student in such a situation (which is fine, you have no obligation to do this), then keep scrolling.

To conclude, this has been a humbling experience for me. Cheating is bad, so don't do it. Just think of Auntie Sophie with a broom hovering over you every time you get the temptation to cheat! Best of luck this semester, try your best, be kind and DON'T CHEAT :)

Note 2: Links to the BC Gratuities and Redistribution of Gratuities Act will be at the bottom. 

Tipping culture needs to gooooo and the only way tipping culture will end here is if we all collectively stop doing it and spread the message. With inflation and the cost of living soaring in BC, plus the fact that all BC worker make a minimum of $16 no matter the industry is more than enough reason to end it. 

• Argument that it supplements a workers wage because they don’t make minimum wage

———-False in BC it’s law that all workers make minimum wage. 

•Argument that workplaces automatically take 5%-10% of you wage to tip out no matter what 

———-That’s illegal and you should contact the proper authorities as the the law clearly states only gratuities can be pooled and split 

• Argument that it’s a service job and someone’s doing something for you, like walking back and forth from the kitchen…. 

——— There’s many many many service jobs that exist that don’t take tips and make minimum wage only. Why is that someone who works at McDonald’s and arguably has a much more stressful job than someone working at Cactus server, makes no tips but the cactus server does. 


I would like to discuss this with further will be and would love to hear what other people think. Personally I think the message needs to spread now more than ever. The only way we stop the culture is to actually stop doing it ourselves. Collectively we could make it end and it could also start making work places pay a livable wage to people.

104225,i was a first year in and was roofied at a sigma chi party im a guy so i assume it wasnt intended for me and thankfully nothing bad happened it was a very scary realization afterwards its disgusting this shit goes on i hope youre okay and hope everyone stays safe,Roofied @ TRH Bar,2022-11-14 17:11:17,McGill,,"This weekend I went to Trash Bar on Saint Laurent with a few friends to grab a drink. I had one drink and drank it while we watched some people skating. Roughly an hour later one of my friends had a very intense dizzy spell and decided to call a cab, chocking it up to being the fault of her dab pen. 45 minutes later I collapsed unconcious waiting in line on the stairs at coat check. I don't know how long I was unconcious for but when I came to I was unable to speak and could barely see. I hit my head when I fell and got pretty banged/bruised, and I couldn't speak coherently until I was able to throw up. Luckily my friends found me quickly, but I want to make sure I share this because this was a very frightening experience and I imagine that whoever is orchestrating this is waiting until a person gets caught without their friends in a less visible area. The only way that my friend and I's drink could have been tampered with is if someone slipped it in while sliding past us, or if it came directly from the bartender herself. Be careful guys, watching your drink isn't always enough.  I've read other things about this bar and it has a troubling history of being unsafe for women and supporting security guards that have been convicted of sexual assualt. We'll be avoiding places like these altogether from now on.

32339,oh shit i leave wet sponges on the counter all the time,To that one person I had to room with,2021-05-10 14:58:11,UofT,Discussion,"You were like the idealized university person I daydreamed about back when I was in highschool. You were ambitious, smart, and so orderly and neat. Later I realized that you were only ambitious, apparently. I admired you deeply but even I know now that what we had was a slow burn falling out of love more than anything else.

First of all, I didn't know it was possible for a life science student to leave a wet sponge on the counter. You ace every class, reminded me every other week that your research internship was more intellectually stimulating than my technician summer job, and came here on a whopping scholarship. Did it not occur to you that **bacteria** grows when you leave a damp sponge unattended on the counter? I thought you were a biology kid. You told me you were a neat freak. I loved that about you, because I too, loved to vacuum and loved to arrange things in a particular order. Turns out, you meant you liked collecting stationary and I am wholeheartedly heartbroken. 

Secondly, it baffles me how often you waste. My expectations were never to be modest or make haste with very little. Upon the first few weeks of meeting you, we would talk for hours about the wiles and despicable deeds of large corporations on the environment and I felt the passion of your words and let them motivate me. So riddle me this, why do you leave all the lights on everytime you leave? Leave the water running for minutes while you go back to your room to grab something? Why do you insist on throwing out packaging when we can reuse it for something else? The way you lied about your virtues and walked back on them mere minutes later was one of the most unforgivable things about you. It made me question if there was honesty in anything you said. Anyway, please turn your lights off before you leave, jeez.

Finally, there has always been one thing that has bothered me about the way you talked about school. I was estatic to live with you. We were friends and I had no idea if you felt the same way about me but I was always ready to take on the burden of apartment-duties while you were busy. But with the rosy glasses now off, I gotta ask: tf did you mean when you said you couldn't do housework because you were a full time student? Bro, so was I!?! 

Wherever you are, I hope you are doing well. You were one of the few people I've ever loved and also the one who finally convinced me that higher education is no indication of a person's intelligence. May you finally learn how to boil water by yourself. Goodbye, my friend!","['oh', 'shit', 'leave', 'wet', 'sponge', 'counter', 'time']",,-0.5859,oh shit leave wet sponge counter time

99997,im curious why does amnesty international and the united nations two respected international organizations are saying that israel is committing crimes against humanity and apartheid against palestine is that a coincidence,Is McGill Admin Threatening to Kill SSMU?,2022-03-24 20:47:42,McGill,MEGATHREAD,"I'm sure everyone interested in these topics has read their email.

The McGill Administration is threatening to terminate the [memorandum of agreement](https://www.mcgill.ca/studentlifeandlearning/files/studentlifeandlearning/may_31_2024.pdf) between SSMU and the University should SSMU not immediately abandon its (democratically decided upon) [Palestine Solidarity Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1drVfxAnCjS8mwDuzDrY85y-62PXm-IdU2XgUz17qOa0/edit).

From what I understand, this memorandum essentially outlines the relationship between the University and the Students Union. This, and feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, is where a lot of SSMU's power is derived from.

I think it's possible to discuss the merits of the Palestine policy. I, for one, am in favour of it. Be that as it may, the key part of the email is as follows:

""As Deputy Provost, I have communicated these concerns to the SSMU leadership and advised them to take prompt and appropriate remedial action, consistent with SSMU’s obligations under its Memorandum of Agreement with the University, failing which the University will terminate this Memorandum of Agreement.""

Say what you will about SSMU, but this is an affront to the slim amount of democracy we as students are entitled to here at McGill. I'm not impressed by the administrations attempt at overreach.

I'm interested to hear other opinions on the matter.

90980,okay i do want to point out that the referendum had voter turnout so cannot be said to represent the majority of students no vote doesnt always mean power unexercised it can also represent a statement of apathy towards a topic my problem with all this is that these kind of votes shouldnt be held by a general student union like ssmu their job as an organistion is to represent all students as best they can and look out for their interests besides international geopolitics being beyond their scope holding votes like this is highly devisive yeah i know the resolution in the referendum passed with like of the votes but my thing is that this is a highly polarizing topic im not here to start another debate on the situation over there but i think we have to acknowledge that the discussions around it are highly polarized and the underlying issues complicated the general wording of the resolutions sounds very easy to get behind antiwar and stuff like that but it does advocate to boycott anything and everyone associated with israel in any way while ignoring any palestinian atrocities it almost certainly goes against the values of a sizable chunk of mcgill students whether or not we agree with those values is not whats important here its that the organisation for all students is taking a position that des not represent many mcgill students again i really dont want to pick sides here im just trying to say that this isnt an apolitical resolution by the ssmu and this is kinda my whole point in a nutshell i dont think most mcgill students want to pick a side or want any part in this conflict whatsoever yet by the students society of mcgill adopting this resolution every students name is attached to the conflict at least a bit i dont think its appropriate to drag us all into this or any other foreign conflict regardless of how callous any one sides conduct may or may not be university is supposed to be a place for freethinkers where people of all ideals and backgrounds come to expand their intellectual horizons and for that reason i dont think that ssmu has any business taking strong stances on most things focus on tuition hikes and other issues that impact the quality of education for all mcgill students xb feel free to disagree with me unlike so many others expressing their opinions here i wont call you evil and stupid for holding a different position than me also please note i dont know very much about the conflict other than that theres alot i dont know which is part of why i didnt like ssmu bringing me into this conversation,Judge

61520,truly a peak reddit moment,To whoever saved my ass (literally)  yesterday I owe you my life,2024-09-19 19:20:25,UBC,,"I was napping in the little Buchanan coffee shop, woke up, read the last of what i needed to for my 2oc class. (1:52) I had to shit, if I didn't shit before class I'd be either gassing out whoever sat next to me or in extreme discomfort. I go to the bathroom, do my deed (side note there was a vape on the ground next to the toilet, someone else was having a bad day too) and go to wipe. BUT there was not the required facilities (toilet paper). (1:58) I'm panicking. I stand up (I'm relatively tall, enough to see over the partitions, not that thats saying much seriously wtf UBC anyone over 6'3"" could accidentally see everything just by standing up) and theres like 5 ppl in the bathroom, one dude in the stall next to about to leave the chamber. I wait a second, It's just two dudes now. 

""yo, yo, dude"" I say to the guy leaving his stall
he has airpod's in
i turn my attention to the guy at the sink
""hey, yo dude""
we make eye contact, i'm peering over the partition
""yo i'm so sorry but can you do me a favor, this stall is out of toilet paper and i REALLY need to get to class. can you hand me some over the wall?""
""oh yeah sure, i'll grab as much as i can"" he responds
""thank you so fucking much"" i could hug this man if my undies weren't around my knees 
he gives me the perfect amount, just a little more than i needed to be spic and span. 

i doubt i'll ever see you again, but you proved to me humanity is still alive 

i made it to class just 2 minutes late

(p.s. i grabbed like 10 paper towels from the dispenser and put them on top of the toilet paper dispenser before i left, i know it's not glamorous, but i hope it saved someone who might not have a guardian angel (kind bathroom man) on their side)

33497,tbh he really doesnt have to be a student also those ppl at the desks dont check squat except like lady its situations like this that absolutely rattle me to the bone those upper floors on robarts feel so isolated from the outside world and for something to happen up there god i dunno,Creepy Interaction at Robarts Today,2022-07-17 21:40:32,UofT,Other,"\*\*\*UPDATE: For those who have been concerned about this/asked me to report it: I talked to campus safety, explained what happened, and just got off a call with the officer who is filing the report! I was nervous to make these calls, but everyone was empathetic, supportive, and glad to have this information. Also, and while I appreciate all the support I've gotten on this post, I am going to stop using this account now/checking on this. The dismissive and harmful comments are few, but still too much for me to handle after experiencing this. Thanks.\*\*\*

I am still shaking out of fear/adrenaline, but I want to get my thoughts down so I don't forget them. Let me preface by saying that this person did not explicitly threaten or physically harm me, so don't worry about having to read anything like that.

Basically, I had a very strange interaction at Robarts this afternoon while sitting in the third floor media commons. A man came in and walked over to me (I was one of maybe seven people in the room) and just hovered next to my chair before asking if I knew whether the doors were locked. I became a little suspicious (because why would he want to know that?) but I told him that I wasn’t sure. I think I also asked “why?” but I don't remember his answer.

He then walked across the room to go and check the backdoors himself. On the way there, he stopped to say something to the only other woman in the room, which seemed like a transparent/ deliberate choice... Anyway, he proceeded to shake the handles of those doors to see if they were locked (again, why??) and I started packing up due to bewilderment and umm... fear?? But of course, the man saw me gathering my things, came back, lingered uncomfortably by my chair, and then told me to have a good day. I took my time packing while he walked away, hoping he would just leave, but he ended up returning a third time and asked,  “what time did you say it was?” For reference, I did not say, and it seemed like he just wanted excuses to keep me talking to him. As a younger female student, this was officially making me anxious. He looked to be about 30 years old, perhaps a student, but his behavior was so out of place: he spoke too loudly for a university library room, he was eating out of multiple opened bags of food, he had loud music playing through over-the-ear headphones which were hung around his neck like speakers....oh, and he had just returned from shaking the backdoors to see if any were locked?!

I told him it was 3:45, smiled at him, and he gave me a big old creepy smile in return before finally leaving. Had it ended there, I would have felt confused, intimidated, but relieved it was over. What I hadn’t known was that he was still pacing the hallway outside, essentially blocking my way to the down escalator. When I got out of the room, I had to board the upstairs one and find an exit from there.

I was going to wait on the fourth floor for him to leave, but he saw me from downstairs, and immediately went for the up escalator. I was afraid to go near there so I'd called an elevator, but it arrived as soon as he got to my floor. I instinctively walked away from it, not wanting to risk being in an enclosed space with this guy. And then a fun little terrifying dance began. He watched me speed-walk into the random room on the fourth floor and aimlessly pace around while I waited for him to go away. Yes. He literally stood outside the glass wall of the room, watching me, like I was a fish in a bowl. He saw me walk over to whatever office is in the back of that room, which turned out to be empty, but the choice was enough to get him to leave me alone. He disappeared, thank god, and I took my opportunity to get the heck out of there.

Again, this might sound like a long story about nothing, but I swear my heart was racing the entire time. When I got the courage to leave the fourth floor, I had to call my partner and stay on the line until I got outside, just to stay calm. I ended up seeing the man one more time when I finally reached the ground floor. He'd beaten me there and was sitting near the printing area (which is on the way to the exit). I had to spin around and go the long way just to avoid him seeing me (and potentially following me onto the street!). And okay-- I don't know what I was specifically afraid of. It's not like he threatened me explicitly. But his *behavior* felt like a threat, and also it was plain weird-- from standing over me (and way too close) to ask if backdoors were locked, from only approaching the women with his multiple, random, and intimidating, questions, from shaking the goddamn doors to see if they were locked, to the extremely obvious way he followed me around the building!

So even though nothing explicitly threatening was said, those few minutes were enough to make me extremely fearful. I wish it didn't take so little for someone to completely ruin an otherwise nice, productive, day at the library, but here we are. Now I'm posting on Reddit from an anonymous account (in case he finds this post), hoping to, what, find solace on the Internet? Ugh.

I'll be okay. It was just scary.

tl,dr: A stranger walked into a reading room I was in, asked me if the back-doors were locked, and then began physically checking them himself. When I tried to leave, he waited by the downstairs escalator. I went up, and then got followed for a few, very very long, minutes. It really freaked me out :(","['tbh', 'really', 'doesnt', 'student', 'also', 'ppl', 'desk', 'dont', 'check', 'squat', 'except', 'like', 'lady', 'situation', 'like', 'absolutely', 'rattle', 'bone', 'upper', 'floor', 'robarts', 'feel', 'isolated', 'outside', 'world', 'something', 'happen', 'god', 'dunno']",,0.4782,tbh really doesnt student also ppl desk dont check squat except like lady situation like absolutely rattle bone upper floor robarts feel isolated outside world something happen god dunno

The reasoning is simple. Without a megathread, /r/UBC would be flooded with nothing but questions that apply to only a small percentage of the UBC population.

**Examples of questions that belong here**

- comparing courses or instructors
- asking about how hard an exam is
- syllabus requests
- inquiries about majors, programs, and job prospects
- ""what-to-do if I failed/was late/missed the cutoff""

**What you don't need to post here**

- **Post-exam threads** (ex. 'How did you find the Birb 102 midterm)
- rants, raves, shout-outs or criticisms of programs. 
- Other content that is not a question/inquiry

**Process**

- It might take up to 4 hours for your post to be approved (except when we're sleeping). 
- Suggested sort is set to new, so new comments will always be the most visible. 
- You are allowed to repost the same question on the megathread at a reasonable frequency (wait at least a day after each post). This is true even if you've already gotten a response.**

I believe that I can well represent undergraduate students on this committee as I am a very involved student at UBC. I am the president of the UBC Law and Society Chats (LASOC), an academic club focused on bringing together and inspiring like-minded peers from a variety of disciplines to contemplate the role of the law in our everyday lives. In this club, I oversee events which focus on social justice and law. In addition, I have been a legal assistant at Meunier Carrier Lawyers for over three years and I manage each client’s information with confidentiality and respect. I work very hard to draft Statement of Claims, Affidavit of Documents, Offers, and more to ensure that these clients are receiving the justice to which they are entitled. Furthermore, I was a bank teller for over a year, and I handled client’s banking and personal information privately. These positions helped me build on my communication, organization, and teamwork skills. I am confident that I can be of great use on this committee because I am an impartial person dedicated to selecting the correct person for this position. I would be pleased to contribute my time and efforts to this decision process.

103371,absolutely tell your prof,Dude creeping on me from one of my classes,2021-01-10 01:56:51,McGill,,"So I received a request on messenger from a guy in one of my classes with your classic are you in this class message.  I didn't see it until today when I got an email (to my McGill email) from the same guy that basically said he's seen me on Zoom in class and since I've ignored his messenger text he's sent me an email to tell me he's in love with me and we should have a conversation and basically a lot of other creepy, boundary-crossing stuff.

It's a small class with frequent breakout room meetings, so I think I'm going to email the prof just to request we are never placed in the same room together. I've never been in this situation so if anybody has any advice on what I should do that would be great. For reference, we aren't in the same city so I'm not worried about running into him or anything. Also, if anybody knows what I should do if this were to escalate, that would be helpful as well.

Thanks everyone!

I started my BSC in 2014 wanting to go into medicine. Years of mental illness, suicidal thoughts and just general unease with life followed. I questioned every single thing: why I came to UBC, was I enough, will I make it, oh my god how will I make it through this week? 

After dropping out in 2017 with the support of my doctor, I was devastated. I worked so hard under financial, mental and familial stress wanting to achieve … SOMETHING. It was medicine but at that point I was just trying to stay alive. Thank god for my psychiatrist from UBC Student Health who saved my life multiple times.

Psychiatric ward visits became normal and before dropping out I had to fake it all and keep going. 2 years after dropping out I ended up (forcibly) at a therapists office. Reluctantly I gave it a shot because what else did I have to lose? 

Fast forward, I am finishing my degree in about 2 weeks… I decided to go back to school just to finish what I started. I don’t know where I’m going. All I know is the person that walked into this degree is VASTLY different from the person who is about to walk out. 

I have been through the most darkest thoughts and I wanted to share this to let anyone else that’s struggling know that YOU WILL MAKE IT. So long as you take care of yourself, anything is possible. I was revving up an engine on empty… and I almost died. Many times. 

I am so excited to finally see the end of this degree! UBC you have been the sweetest pain in the ass. PEACE OUT! 😩😩😩","['awesome', 'job', 'friend', 'glad', 'hear', 'managed', 'pull', 'end']",,0.9035,awesome job friend glad hear managed pull end

Hello future McGillians! We know that you have lots of questions, and we're here to help answer them. To keep the subreddit orderly, all that we ask is that you restrict discussion to this megathread. All other posts will be removed.

Before you comment, please **read the FAQs below**, and note that administrative inquires about requirements, deadlines, financial aid, etc. are best directed to [Service Point](https://www.mcgill.ca/servicepoint).

You might also try asking your question [here](http://ask.mcgill.ca/) on the McGill website.

**What are my chances of getting in? When will I receive a decision?**

We aren't admissions officers, so we can't tell you anything beyond the general rule that offers are made in waves, based on grades and test scores, until all available spaces are filled. This means that the higher you are above the [minimum requirements](https://www.mcgill.ca/applying/requirements) for your program, the better your odds of acceptance, and the [sooner you're likely to hear back](https://www.mcgill.ca/applying/nextsteps/decision).

However, simply being above the minimum requirements is not a guarantee of admission.

**If I don't meet the requirements for the program I want, can I get into another program and then transfer?**

Transferring into most programs is a lot harder than getting admitted to them in the first place, so while this is a possible route to take, it's a big risk as you would have to substantially improve your academic performance in your first year.

**What if I'm accepted with my predicted grades or scores, but then they go down a little?**

As long as you pass all of your classes and graduate from your current high school or CEGEP, you'll be fine.

**Is McGill better than this other university? Is a McGill degree good for jobs?**

Most of us haven't attended any other universities or been in the labour market for very long, so we probably can't give you an informed opinion.

**How hard is it to get a high GPA at McGill? I've heard there's grade deflation.**

It's hard—McGill will not hold your hand—but it's also perfectly possible to graduate with a high GPA if you take courses that interest you and manage your time efficiently. In other words, your perception of difficulty will vary based on your program and your academic background, such as how good the study skills you developed in high school are.

Different faculties and departments have different policies when it comes to forcibly curving a class's grades down so that there's a certain average (also known as ""grade deflation"").

**What is student life like?**

Lots and lots has already been said about this topic. [Read through some past threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/search?q=student+life+-flair%3ASSMU&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) to get some ideas.

Broadly speaking, being in the midst of a city as fun and affordable as Montreal, socializing tends to happen off-campus. There is a visible party culture, so if that's up your alley you will probably find it easier to make friends. However, with 27,000 undergraduates and hundreds of clubs, there is a niche for everyone. You may just have to look a little harder to find yours.

Of course, a big part of life in Montreal is dealing with winter. Seasonal depression is real, so consider your ability to tolerate five months of overcast days with 4 pm sunsets, freezing temperatures (sometimes as low as -30° C with wind chill), and occasional icy sidewalks that make getting to class downright hazardous.

**Do I need to speak French to come to McGill?**

No. Montreal is a relatively bilingual city, so you can spend four years here and get by without a word of French. However, your life will be much easier and more opportunities will be available to you if you can speak—or make an effort to learn—un peu de français.

**I've accepted my offer! What next?**

6483,and now you cant argue cause u tried to put trash into other persons mouth ppl like you are real intelligent,"As promised, I strolled through Kings College and this is what it looked like",2024-05-23 17:39:51,UofT,Discussion,"Just want to start by saying that I don’t remotely belong to either cultural group. I was born in Toronto and have had the privilege of a life without civil war. My only stake in this situation is that I was a student during the fall/winter semester when the conflict started hitting headlines and I’ll be graduating in June. I’ll be observing the people who will be protesting on convocation day alongside my peers, who have all been pretty quiet about this topic. This post is for the people who are curious to know what their graduation ceremony is going to look like if its at the convocation hall next week.

The impression I got from this encampment was this: it was quiet, there wasnt anybody blocking doors to the adjacent buildings, and there wasnt really an air of chaos that has been exaggerated on insta. Its peaceful. It was just asian tourists visiting the campus for their kids and people going to and from class. There is an entrance to the encampment thats being guarded by a handful of people, but not much human activity. Of the 6 whole protestors I saw, it wasnt exactly a mixed group, but my sample size is too low to really confirm anything. No they were not wearing masks or trying to conceal their identity. Unfortunately it smells like weed and other things you could guess would come from an encampment, but thats to be expected. In contrast, there was a lot of construction going on and contractors working all around the encampment. I feel a little bad. That whole stretch of park has no shade so I wager its hot as hell in there.

So no, Kings College isnt a warzone, and you can go about convocation without feeling unsafe. There are a number of places where you can take decent pictures without getting tents in the background. Nobody is blocking doors and going after eachother.

—

One person on this reddit said that uoft put the fence up to deliberately stop the anticipation of a protest, but after visiting today I think that’s just bs. 🤦‍♀️ I counted at least 3 other sites that were fenced off for construction and landscaping all around the circle. Plus, the work that is being prepared for the circle was no different from the construction on Robarts and Woodsworth. Its ironic that this same fence is now being used as a barrier preventing contractors, or really anybody, from entering the park. I did not try to enter this checkpoint thing, and I’m aware that other journalists have attempted to do this with varying results.

I finally formed an opinion on this. I think it’s great that people are practicing their freedom of expression. You should be allowed to advocate for vulnerable groups without getting shot by cops. While I think the war/crimes against humanity is awful, I actually don’t really support the encampment and their demands. Literally every facet of our country has had a direct and indirect involvement in supporting warfare beyond our borders. So even if they were to succeed in getting UofT to stop being involved with companies like Hebrew University of Jerusalem(??), or the Daughters for Life Foundation (?????) I honestly dont believe the unrelenting warfare in the middle east-east asia will ever really end. Children will still die at the same rate, relief workers will still die, genocides are still going to be funded by Canadian corpos, families will still face tragedy, and the isms will continue onward because nobody can agree on how the borders should be redrawn. 

A brief crash course on the history of Israel in my undergrad still feels true to me. I know that is my oblivious privilege talking, but this is all I see before me. There are so many problems in the world and I only have the energy for the ones happening here on this side of the globe. The fentanyl epidemic, the children who make up the majority of clients in Canadian foodbanks, the unaffordability of life as we know it, and the isolated elderly populace here in the GTA have my full attention. 

I’m at peace with the protest and I wish the protesters well. If they get UofT to yield to their demands, that is awesome and I’ll applaud their efforts. I hope other people find their peace with this too.
