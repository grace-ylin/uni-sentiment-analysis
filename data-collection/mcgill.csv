1702496003.0,I've Cheated on Every Evaluation so far at McGill,"I cheat on every eval and exam I take at McGill. Here’s how:

I show up to class right I have a notebook on my lap where I write down what the professor is talking about! Every one else messes around on their laptops playing chess or scrolling through memes, I'm the only smart one because I'm copying what the prof says (Real sneaky so no one notices.) Then, I look at these hand made notes for a few minutes everyday, increasing the time I look at them as I get closer to the test. I walk in, take the test (remembering everything the professor said!) and then walk out of there Mission Impossible style. It's almost impossible to get caught cheating this way. (secret)

1736718470.0,"Without Floor Fellows, First Years are Falling Through the Cracks","A student died yesterday. I don't know them, nor how it happened, but it happened. It would be disrespectful to the dead to speculate on what happened, but I think these two events speak to a larger issue within McGill student residences. As many of you are aware, McGill announced last year the decision to eliminate Floor Fellows in favour of so-called ""Residence Life Managers"" (RLMs). I was not a student at the time, but I know this decision was widely criticized for its potential to deprive first years of essential resources that could help them in a crisis. As far as I am aware, however, these debates have since died down. I feel that these tragic events are reason enough to finally reopen the discussion.

As a first year student, I have long been frustrated with the way support for first years is provided. To be blunt, ""RLMs"" are useless. As individuals, I am sure that they are caring people who want to do whatever they can to support first years, and so I do not wish to indict anybody individually here, they are not at fault. However, as an institution they are completely ineffective. I have maybe seen my RLMs once or twice throughout the year, and that was during frosh when they essentially were just there to herd us like preschoolers into Tomlinson Fieldhouse for us to play some ""orientation games"". I have not seen them since. Barely involved in social media activities or even to try and visibly organize events beyond the occasional poster, I don't believe anybody I know knows who their RLMs are or where to see them. They stand aloof from us and yet we're supposed to turn to them for support in a crisis.

This brings me to my next issue: their complete inaccessibility. The whole point of having a Floor Fellow or an RA in general is to have someone who is readily accessible for support whenever students need them. The fact that they are only accessible via office hours, which for the record are barely advertised, is frankly nonsensical. If I or someone else, struggling with the burdens of first year and, for many, the first time being away from home, is feeling suicidal, what we need is immediate support from someone that can be trusted. Instead, what we get is needing to navigate a confusing bureaucracy only to have the only support available be someone that is effectively a stranger in an office who will meet you at 3:00 PM on a Tuesday in two weeks. Because it makes sense for the suicidal ideations of an isolated first year to be treated as equivalent to a mundane question about the syllabus. And what about students with pre-existing or emerging health issues? The bureaucracy of both the Student Wellness Hub and the Quebec healthcare system for someone not from Quebec would be enough to make Kafka blush. What is there for students who need help navigating this system or require easily accessible support?

I am thankful to be surrounded by supportive friends and people who would be there for me if ever a crisis arose. But many do not have this luxury. Many first year students have few or even no friends at McGill. This may be the first time they've ever left home. They may not be confident in their English or in French, resulting in further feelings of alienation at McGill. This may be their first time exposed to alcohol or drugs, and it being possibly their only way of finally feeling accepted in their new home, they may push themselves far beyond their limits. And the only people there to help them if that happens are a bunch of severely drunk freshman who probably could not give less of a shit about their wellbeing.

To die, just as one is entering the world, with hopes and dreams for what your life could be that will never be realized, is tragic. I don't know this person, and I will reiterate that I will not speculate on how they died out of respect for themselves, their friends, and their family. Maybe having Floor Fellows could not have prevented these things from happening. Regardless of the circumstances, may they rest in peace, and I hope those closest to them may find peace and healing. Nonetheless, these events are concerning in light of the overarching fact that first years are falling through the cracks at McGill, not by accident or by lack of funding, but by a conscious decision to eliminate a vital service to provide immediate support for vulnerable first years. And I think the most damning fact about all of this is that all that the university could provide in light of yesterday's events for students possibly now dealing with the trauma of witnessing what had transpired were a singular Resident Life Manager only accessible from the hours of 10 to 4 and a link to a help line.

I believe it is necessary to petition the university to make change, to reinstitute Floor Fellows and to offer further support and resources for students that could actually make a difference in their lives, rather than placing them in the hands of distant administrators. As an individual, I cannot do much, and I am unfamiliar with how to petition the university or the SSMU. But I can't stand around and say nothing. McGill, in their efforts to cut corners, has put the lives of countless first years at risk. This cannot continue.

Il l'est toujours. Donc il est directement de sa responsabilité de décrire la position du PQ sur ces enjeux.\n\nLe fait que la position officielle du PQ est de protester contre le projet New Vic démontre au-delà de tout doute raisonnable que le end goal du PQ n'est pas de proposer une solution nuancée pour restructurer le milieu universitaire québécois.

La structure financière actuelle de l'université ne permet pas de faire face à son déficit d'infrastructure de 1.5 milliards. On en est rendus à faire des rénovations temporaires (chères) en attendant d'avoir les fonds pour faire les rénovations permanentes (trop chères). C'est un cercle vicieux qui ne va qu'empirer. Oui, les autres universités du Québec sont également en difficulté financières, mais ce n'est pas parce que McGill ''en a trop''.\n2. **McGill ne dessert pas exclusivement les populations anglophones du Québec.** L'université agit comme capteur de cerveaux, à la fois pour amener des gens qui viennent ici et viennent contribuer au secteur de la recherche et de l'innovation (et dieu sait qu'être capables de maintenir un secteur de l'innovation est central à l'affirmation d'une nation québécoise dans le contexte politique et le marché canadien), et pour retenir des canadiens français intéressés par la recherche qui, sans l'existence de McGill, auraient plus de chances de quitter le Québec. Personnellement, en tant que québécois purement francophone (seule personne de ma famille à parler anglais), mcgill m'a permis de faire de la recherche de pointe qui ne se fait pas ailleurs au Québec.\n3. **La langue de la recherche est l'anglais, que ce soit à mcgill ou à l'UdeM.** Toutes les paniques morales nationalistes, notamment des sorties consternantes du bloc et du PQ cette année, sur la langue de la recherche, sont complètement ignorantes de la réalité de la recherche. Que ce soit dans un établissement français ou anglais, les chercheurs vont communiquer dans une lingua franca qui, dans la majorité des champs de recherche, est l'anglais. Ce n'est pas angliciser le québec, ou s'angliciser soi-même, de publier un article scientifique en anglais. La lutte contre la présence de l'anglais dans les universités est avant tout une stratégie de communication basée sur le fear mongering, et ça me fait de la peine de voir le PQ et le bloc tomber aussi bas.\n\n> Comme j’ai dit: il y a effectivement un débat à avoir sur l’impact que notre système universitaire anglophone a sur la langue parlée au centre-ville de Montréal.

(Innocent until proven guilty, my ass!) Both the families I mention in a thread below lost their homes after the cops came over; they were otherwise good tenants, but landlords are very cagey about this sort of this because the state/government can seize properties that allow crime. Many of you clearly have no idea how fucked up the us legal system is. (Even if you\'re from the US, you\'re usually at least upper middle class if you can go to McGill and that will significantly insulate you from much of the ugliness, at least until recently. The US system favors wealth and state power. If you get down to the nitty gritty it\'s a shocking system, frankly. The US is an incredibly cruel place to be poor, even when contrasted with places like Latin America (for example, many poor women in Latin America support their family via cottage industries like vending and food prep—doing these in the US without an expensive and difficult to obtain ""license"" is a crime). This is merely one example of the many, many, many ways the USA criminalizes being poor.', '[deleted]', 'the timeline adds up...', 'Inspiriging', 'Clever take. ;)', '🦀', 'Intersectional Imperialism', '""colored woman""? what year is it, 1965?', 'WE 👏 NEED 👏 MORE 👏 DIVERSE 👏 OPPRESSORS 👏', '> now at least more innocent African Americans can be jailed and our working class can be sent to more foreign conflicts because a colored woman is in government\n\nYes, Kamala Harris is personally responsible for the privatization of the prison system in and the overincarceration of POC individuals in America.

Republicans need to be brought kicking and screaming into the 21st century. **When Democrats do nothing, it\'s because their hands are politically tied.**\n\nWhile I love people like Bernie Sanders, people who appear too left wing get absolutely crucified in elections within America.

Keeping that in mind, I don\'t understand why people dislike Harris so much. \n\nThis is the democratic party that managed to win the presidency, win back the senate in Georgia (ofc with tons of help from Stacey Abrams) and retain control of the house. For now, it is *not* the time to dunk on democratic strategy, because it **worked**.\n\nThese issues will not be fixed overnight. The Georgia senate race proved that the POC community can have a real impact on American democracy. Kamala Harris being VP *is* a positive thing imo. I think she\'s more savvy and strategic than you think. \n\nGive her a chance in her role as VP before virtue signaling willy-nilly.\n\n**Edit:** I\'m open to changing my mind.

1696740109.0,shat my pants in my midterm on thursday and i can’t stop thinking about it,"i’m writing this through tears. i had my first midterm as a university student on thursday and i was so nervous going in. i didn’t sleep for 3 days, and was surviving on 4 large coffees from the dep to function. i think the last one really did it for me… 

after i got to my exam, i really needed to use the bathroom. But we were not allowed to leave, so I held it all in. by the 10th question, i started leaking some gas. my stomach was gurglin like a witch’s boiling cauldron. i know people around me smelled it cz i heard people clearing their throats and chairs scraping super loudly every time a toot slipped through the cracks. I was so embarrassed I started shivering and shaking in my seat. my leg started twitching and that’s when it happened.

 at this point there were 15 minutes left. I could feel the warmth I was sitting on and suddenly became hyper aware of my surroundings. As soon as it happened I couldnt help but sit up tall in shock from the discomfort and started looking around to see if anyone noticed. I can’t lie my eyes were darting around the entire room. the TA saw me looking around so frantically and approached me whispering about keeping my eyes on my paper, but when they were about 10 feet away they paused and got a bewildered look on their face, and turned up their nose in disgust.

 I felt so shitty and afraid I couldn’t even finish my exam. When the time ran out I was glued to my seat. I couldn’t get up. So I tried to finish up whatever I could on the exam, as fast as I could. There was a class coming in and the prof and TA were yelling at me to stop writing but I refused to get up. 

At this point the TA stormed over and snatched  my paper and gasped “oh my”, which prompted another rip of nervousness from me. I burst into tears and kept farting liquid at the same time. I knew that I just had to clench and get out of there as fast as possible. When I got up from my seat, all I could think about was how the hell I was going to grab my sh*t and get out of there. I was contemplating how to kneel down to get my tote bag without bending over when i saw it. the thickest rear view stripe I have ever see on the seat. I slowly looked up and locked eyes with the TA. I couldn’t take it anymore. I just clenched my cheeks for dear life and ran.

I haven’t been able to sleep soundly since. I am so freaked out and keep having nightmare flashbacks of the TA’s face and another one of some poop emoji haunting me.  

do you guys think my TA can forget this? i can’t stop thinking about if there was a camera that filmed the whole thing, could TA report me for academic misconduct? I am just a first year and I need help

1583789415.0,Addressing COVID-19 and misinformation,"# Last Updated, 14/3/2020. Since this is no longer pinned, it will be more of an information thread as originally intended, so I won't be updating the TLDR bits as much . Use this as a means of educating yourself on COVID-19 as well as discovering useful resources in tracking/learning about the virus.

There are two arguments regarding the novel coronavirus. One is the panic reaction, and the other is the opposite, saying people are overreacting. Both are too far in one direction.

**I want to re-iterate that this virus knows no borders and is not an excuse to be racist towards Chinese people who literally have no control over any of this. They probably have suffered most in the last few months.** If anything, take your frustrations out towards the Chinese government for mishandling the situation early on.

**TLDR International Situation**

* There is no point in summarizing this since this is a rapidly evolving situation. Please refer to the resources on the bottom of this post or this [tracker](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6). I also highly recommend viewing WHO's [daily situation reports.](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/)
* Generally, many countries are now outside containment are in mitigation.
* As for China, their cases have tapered off and the focus has shifted internationally.
* This is now the first coronavirus to be declared a pandemic

**TLDR Canada Situation  \[As of 13/03/2020\]**

* The Government of Canada is warning against all non essential travel outside the country.
* International flights will only be accepted at certain airports (TBA).
* Cruise ships with over 500 people have been banned from docking in Canada until July.
* The risk is still considered low for Canadians (for people who have an issue with this assessment, low risk does not mean ignore that this is happening, please exercise caution).
* For active cases, refer to [PHAC](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection.html)
* Sophie Trudeau has been diagnosed with COVID-19. Justin Trudeau will remain in isolation for 14 days.

**TLDR Current Situation in Quebec \[As of 14/03/2020\]**

* Overall risk remains low.
* All indoor events with more than 250 people have been [banned](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/covid-quebec-march12-1.5494882). Schools can remain open but should not have more than 250 people in the room.
* People returning from abroad should self-isolate for 14 days regardless of where they came from. Anyone with flu symptoms should also self-isolate for 14 days regardless of travel history.
* St. Patrick's Day parade is postponed.
* 24 positive cases. 3 are hospitalized.
* A recent case took public transportation, see [here (french)](https://www.quebec.ca/sante/problemes-de-sante/a-z/coronavirus-2019/#c45931) or [here (english)](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/#c45931) for what forms and dates.
* 4 hospitals designed to treat COVID-19. 2 clinics set-up exclusively for testing, more on the way (see relevant sections below). Tests are no longer being sent to the National Microbiology Lab for confirmation.
* If you are experiencing symptoms, **STAY HOME**, call 1-877-644-4545. See relevant sections below for more information.

**TLDR Situation at McGill \[As of 13/03/2020\]**

[**Please see the new megathread for up to date information**
](https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/fhp232/megathread_novel_coronavirus_covid19_pandemic_all/)

* **Classes and exams have been suspended Friday, March 13, 2020. All campus events that attract more than 250 people will also be cancelled this weekend.** Before you take out your pitchforks, you should assume that this time will be used by McGill to evaluate their options and we will have a more long-term solution by the end of the weekend. **With Quebec suspending in-person instruction for the next 2 weeks, we should expect to receive an official statement from McGill soon.**
* If you are concerned or would like to voice displeasure with the McGill administration, please contact the office of the dean of students. **I'd also like to add that NOT sending more than one email and remaining polite with university administrators is critical. The people you are emailing are humans too. Please treat them with respect.**
   * Email: [deanofstudents@mcgill.ca](mailto:deanofstudents@mcgill.ca)
* From McGill if you email the DoS: Please note that any emails regarding COVID-19 will be forwarded to [covid-19.info@mcgill.ca](mailto:covid-19.info@mcgill.ca) , and you can expect to hear a response back from them within 24 – 48 hours.

**Naming Convention**

Coronaviruses are a family of respiratory viruses which includes the common cold, SARS, MERS and the new novel coronavirus.

The novel coronavirus has officially been named SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it causes is called COVID-19. I kind of use everything interchangeably here but you get the gist of it.

I don't think this is necessary to mention in a sub for a university, but, the name coronavirus is derived from the crown like spikes (corona is latin for crown) on the surface of the virus. This has nothing to do with the beer. Drink to your heart's content.

**“COVID-19 was caused by someone eating bats”**

The actual source of it is unknown. It is likely to have originated from bats, and transmitted to an intermediate host similar to SARS. It was likely transmitted from an animal in a wet market, not from someone eating bats.

\[regardless, these wild life markets need to die. this is not the first epidemic/pandemic that has begun from one and it will not be the last. This has all been very predictable for epidemiologists\]

**""This is a conspiracy and the government are trying to kill us”**

Stop.

**""This started in a Chinese lab”**

Stop.

**""This started in an American lab”**

Stop.

**“The flu kills far more people every year and nobody panics”**

We do not know the exact death rate of novel coronavirus because mild cases can go undiagnosed. But we have to work with the numbers we have and the death rate worldwide according to WHO is around 3.4%. The true rate could be lower and the mortality rate is lower.

Moreover, if you look at South Korea who have wide spread testing and a younger population than the likes of Italy, they have a death rate of 0.7% which is still higher than the seasonal flu.

Looking at the numbers so far, this is far more deadly than the seasonal flu. Additionally, it is estimated that a single person can spread it to 2-2.5 people (source: WHO) which is higher than influenza.

For reference, seasonal influenza has killed 46,000 people in the US this year so far.

Reminder 2: H1N1 is even milder and still killed up to 151,700-575,000 people. We should not allow that to happen. As an FYI, H1N1 has a 0.02 % mortality rate. With the same argument, are you okay with 575,000 people dying?

**“Only old people die from COVID-19”**

It is true that the most at risk group are the elderly or people with underlying health conditions or compromised immune systems.

The fatality rate increases substantially for those over 50 and continues increasing with age. For those below 40, the death rate is low.

Children are also less susceptible to the disease. When they do develop it, symptoms are mild. The reason for this is unknown and this is not conclusive.

This does not mean that you cannot die from COVID-19. In Wuhan, it was observed by the WHO team that young people who did suffer from severe symptoms often deteriorated and died quickly. These were young, fit, and healthy people with no underlying health conditions. Wuhan is of course a special case, but do not assume that every death has been an elderly or sick person.

Am I trying to make you panic? No. At the end of the day, most cases are mild. And even from the severe cases, very few are critical. But, you should not dismiss this as something that won’t affect you.

**“Governments are overreacting, it’s just mild symptoms for most people”**

If this is allowed to spread without containment, health systems will be overwhelmed to the point that quality of healthcare will suffer and many more people will die.

Hospitals are already overwhelmed here in Canada. We’re also still in influenza season. If the government can stay in containment phase, they can reduce the burden on the healthcare system.

Just look at this figure of overcrowding in Quebec ER's, how do you think they would cope with a pandemic?

[An illustration of ER visits without being seen by a doctor: iedm.org](https://preview.redd.it/guebi4am49m41.jpg?width=641&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d4596a6628a603feded7338ea389d64c11282c4)

Please also have consideration for people suffering from other conditions such as cancer. In Wuhan, [access to healthcare for people suffering from cancer dropped](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/world/asia/china-coronavirus-cancer.html) as hospitals filled with coronavirus cases.  Also be considerate of countries with poor medical infrastructure, they would not be able to cope with an influx of cases.

It also reduces the number of people actively being treated. Think of it as a bell curve. If mitigated/contained effectively, think of a wide but short bell curve whereas with none, think of a very high narrow bell curve in which the health system would be overwhelmed.

[Bell curve illustration, only displays on new reddit. Source: flattenthecruve.com](https://preview.redd.it/j4coociy29m41.png?width=2148&format=png&auto=webp&s=11b300ff114249ada2580ffe1021a13e1f576e16)

In short, the notion of, ""let everyone get sick, it'll be fine, most people will recover"" is a mindset that would result in disaster and unnecessary lives lost.

**""It's fine, warm weather will kill the virus""**

There is no evidence that this is seasonal. This is a new virus so we don't know much.

Look at MERS for reference as well, literally birthed in the sweltering heat of the Middle East. We can't just blindly say this will go away in the summer. This will be relevant for the coming months.

**“I should start stockpiling supplies and face masks”**

First off, face masks will likely not help you in terms of catching the disease. A regular surgical will not protect you from coronaviruses. They do not prevent a virus being transmitted to you. It does not have a tight enough fit.

An N95 mask can protect you from coronavirus, however, most people do not wear them properly, and medical professionals have them specially fitted. They’re also uncomfortable and are far from necessary for the average population.

I've seen a lot of people wearing loose fitting N95's or wearing one over large beards. Or even only covering their mouth and not their nose.

For an average person, a face mask could even do more harm than good. People tend to constantly touch and adjust them (thus touching their face) which is what is likely to infect you. I constantly see people touching their masks and adjusting them.

Masks should be worn by people who are sick to reduce spread of the disease or people taking care of the sick.

Please don't use this as an excuse to mock people who wear masks. I  am personally against mask use because I want to stop the panic reaction to hoard and stockpile face masks, and I am following what is recommended by medical professionals. But don't use someone wearing a mask as an excuse to be racist or discriminatory towards people. The use of face masks is very much also a matter of cultural differences amongst our friends from Asia. I'm sure those of us not from North America can relate to having different values.

There is also no point in hoarding months of supplies. I assume you already have enough toilet paper to last 2 weeks, so why people are hoarding a year or several months supply is mind boggling. You should have around 2 weeks of food/supplies at home in case of quarantine but that is sufficient. We do NOT have a shortage of essential supplies here in Canada. Everything is being restocked. 

**“If face masks don’t help you, why do doctor’s wear it!”**

Doctor’s are exposed to far more sick people than you and for a much longer amount of time. They are most at risk in terms of contracting the disease and need to take as many precautions as possible.

Please stop stockpiling masks and save them for sick people or medical professionals.

**If you insist on wearing masks**

Cotton masks or active carbon masks will do absolutely nothing to protect you from droplets. Stick to surgical (although almost realistically nothing as well)/N95.

Dispose of surgical masks every day. Refrain from adjusting them constantly. Sanitize your hand after disposing them.

N95 masks can be reused until damaged/wet.

See how to wear a surgical mask [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrvFrH_npQI)

To re-iterate: Masks are most helpful for healthcare workers or those in close contact with people who are ill; washing your hands is far more effective in controlling the spread of the illness.

**Can my dog get COVID-19?**

Yes and No. There is a dog that tested weakly positive for the disease, but they showed no symptoms of illness.

The reporting of a dog being infected was extremely irresponsible and just done to stoke fear. There is no evidence that your pet will become sick and not much is known (as in there is no reported instance and this is not expected) on whether they can be carriers.  This was likely a case of human to animal transmission but your pet transmitting the disease to others is unlikely through animal to human transmission.

**What do I need to do?**

Practice good hygiene. Wash your hands for 20 seconds with soap. If you do not have access to soap and water, use an alcohol based sanitizer.

If you are sick: please cough into your elbow, not in your hands or the air. If you cough into a tissue, dispose of the tissue immediately and clean your hands. It is jarring how little basic hygiene is practiced.

Be careful on the STM. If you touch the handles, don't touch your phone all day. Sanitize before. Just as an FYI, the STM said they would start cleaning their trains more often which is still not often. From once every 5-6 weeks, it is now every week.

Again, I need to emphasize your phones. They are something we touch without thinking just like our faces. If you leave the metro, (but were using your phone after touching rails inside), disinfect your hand, and touch your phone, you are effectively cancelling out what you just did.

This is not a cure all. You could practice the best hygiene in the world and still be infected through close contact with someone who is infected, but these are good habits to have.

Update: At the moment, you should be practicing social distancing and minimizing contact with others. Stay home. Do go on walks if you need to.  

**What are symptoms**

Symptoms are comparable to the flu.

The most common symptoms by far are dry cough and fever.

There is misinformation floating around that if you have runny nose, you do not have the novel coronavirus. While less likely, runny nose is a possible symptom, as well as fatigue, shortness of breath, headaches, chills, nausea, etc…

You may develop pneumonia. In more serious cases, the pneumonia be severe and people can suffer from organ failure.

Most cases (81%) are mild. 14% are severe. 5% are critical. Of the critical patients, 50% died.

**Is there a cure?**

There is no known cure or specific treatment. You will be treated for your symptoms.

Most people will require no treatment and will recover on their own.

A vaccine should not be expected for at least a year, but it is possible that specific treatment can arrive sooner. Multiple human trials are currently ongoing or planned.

**“People can spread the virus without any symptoms”**

Based on information so far, asymptomatic transmission is rare and represents only a small fraction of cases. For people who are asymptomatic, they do eventually develop symptoms. The possibility of asymptomatic transmission is something where proper hygiene will play a heavy factor.

Update: I just want to add that I am not saying asymptomatic transmission is not possible. It just does not appear to be the main mode of transmission. Data on this can of course change.

There have also been cases where the incubation period has been over 14 days, however, these are far and few and are an edge case. In most cases, the average incubation period is around 5-6 days.

**Can you get sick from it more than once?**

It seems possible, although unlikely, but this is currently an unknown.

Some people who have contracted it twice appeared to have no disease. It's really just an unknown at this point.

**I’ve been travelling and have symptoms**

Please don’t go to class. Do NOT present yourself to an emergency room unannounced. Call 1-877-644-4545 and move from there.

If you are asked to present yourself, do not take public transportation or a taxi. Take private transportation or transportation will likely be arranged for you.

Inform McGill of your situation. They are monitoring the situation and will be understanding if you need to quarantine yourself. The official advice of McGill is to self isolate if you have travelled from anywhere and are experiencing symptoms. If you suffer a similar situation as u/[pmmeyourpuzzlespls](https://www.reddit.com/user/pmmeyourpuzzlespls/), and health authorities turns you away, try to stay home. Continue pushing if you have been an area with a large outbreak.

**I've been travelling in a high risk area but have no symptoms**

If you do not have symptoms but have been to Iran, Northern Italy, or Hubei Province region, you should still self-isolate and monitor for symptoms. This is what McGill formally recommends so they should be able to accommodate you in terms of school regardless of what a prof tells you.

I personally also think you should self isolate if you've been to (all) of Italy, South Korea, Germany, and any other high risk regions, but I cannot comment on how McGill would accommodate you in that case.

UPDATE: As of March 12, 2020, the Government of Quebec are encouraging you to isolate regardless of whether you are symptomatic.

**I have not been travelling and have symptoms**

Stay home.

At this point and time, it is likely that it just a cold or flu. In general, you should stay home no matter what, but I know none of us are going to do that.

If someone you know has recently been to Italy, Iran, South Korea or China, and are also ill, and have been in contact with them, see above.

UPDATE: As of March 12, 2020, the Government of Quebec are encouraging anyone with flu symptoms to stay home regardless of travel history.

**Should I cancel travel plans?**

As of 13/03/2020, travel is being restricted to Canadians. 

Please follow [Canada's travel advisories.](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/advisories)

Moreover, following the directive issued yesterday by the Quebec government and the director of public health, all student travel outside Canada for internships, student exchanges, international mobility programs, competitions or conferences is suspended until further notice.

If you decide to ignore travel advisories, understand that if shit hits the fan, you shouldn't expect Canada to repatriate you (although I wouldn't expect shit to hit the fan again like in the Hubei province). 

Moreover, at this point and time, understand that should you leave the country, you may have issues re-entering. If you do re-enter Canada, you will be required to quarantine for 14 days.


**How is international response?**

China's initial response was deplorable (although still far better than SARS) and they should not be let off the hook, as this could have been avoided.

However, after the fact, their response has been excellent although in an ethical grey area. Big props to China at this point for being proactive. Although their cases are tapering off, they are still ordering more medical equipment and preparing beds in some cities as if an outbreak is still coming.

Basically, had China reacted earlier, the outbreak would have been far less significant. But the converse is also true, if they reacted later, there would have been a significant difference.

Meanwhile internationally, the world had a long time to prepare and many did not take advantage. This is particularly true in Europe where they only started to think about getting more equipment after the fact.

South Korea's response has been excellent. A big differentiator for them is widespread testing which has without doubt helped reduce the spread and death rate.

Iran is likely to have substantially more cases than they are reporting (although this is just an opinion).

**How is Canada’s response?**

Canada’s response has been excellent in terms of tracking cases/containment. We are still in containment. Although that can change depending on the situation in the US.

If the situation in the US continues to worsen, we can expect cases to be exported very soon.

Evidently, this is also a lesson that travel bans do not work or at the very least are not a cure all. Canada has been far from strict in terms of travel restriction as opposed to other countries.

Airplanes are filthy. See how filthy [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKJEDHKPyhg).

**How is McGill's response?**

It is good that they are placing sanitizer throughout the school and are creating awareness for the virus. I would not expect any more measures from McGill unless a case is found on campus or a serious outbreak occurs in Quebec, in which case you can probably expect strict action to be taken.

In other words, not very proactive. It's going to be reactive.

**What is Quebec doing?**

Quebec has designated 4 hospitals to treat the novel coronavirus:

\- The Jewish General \[Montreal\]. The Jewish has an entire pavilion specifically created to deal with infectious diseases which opened in 2016.

\- Sainte Justine \[Montreal\]

\- Quebec Heart and Lung Institute \[Quebec City\]

\- Centre Hospitalier de l’Université Laval \[Quebec City\]

Furthermore, they have also set-up testing clinics specifically for the novel coronavirus. They are located in:

\- Hôtel-Dieu Hospital \[Montreal\]

\- Azur Clinic \[Longueuil\]

There are more clinics planned for or already open, authorities will direct you if necessary.

At least one other clinic is expected to open next week in Quebec City. They are appointment only so you need to call 1-877-644-4545 to be admitted.

On March 12, 2020, they also announced new guidelines on what you should if you are ill. These are sprinkled throughout this post, but if you're too lazy to check, click [here](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/covid-quebec-march12-1.5494882), or check the TLDR on top.

**Takeaway**

* Be calm, be vigilant and listen to authorities
* Practice good hygiene (not because of this only, but in general)
* Stop acting like this is not going to affect you. This is a concerning situation and one you should take seriously. Don't shrug this off as just as bad as the flu. See what Dr. Fauci says [here](https://www.cnn.com/videos/health/2020/03/10/anthony-fauci-americans-sot-wh-coronavirus-briefing-vpx.cnn)
* Follow reputable news sources. A lot are stoking fear and creating clickbait. One example was a recent study that the virus mutated early on. The media decided to twist this, and the word mutation is obviously a scary one to use, particularly for those with no education in sciences. This is normal and expected behaviour.

Therefore, thousands of students, including me, request McGill to suspend all in-person classes and switch to online platforms. \n\nI understand that McGill is following recommendations of Canadian public health authorities, but we cannot afford to wait until one person gets tested positive to suspend in-person classes.

From previous emails and information pages, McGill only mentioned students to self-quarantine if they traveled to certain regions of China, Italy, Iran and South Korea, while ignoring risks posed from other countries with a prominent number of cases that can also spread the virus. There is concrete proof in Quebec where patients, who went touring in the United Kingdom, England, India, France, the United-States, and Dominican Republic tested positive results.\n\nMoreover, most students need to commute by metro/bus to McGill.

It is crucial that no one should feel anxious or vulnerable to attend classes. \n\nI am speaking on the behalf of all McGill students who voiced their concern of this situation. More than 7500 people have signed a petition to switch all in-person to online classes (source below). We also strongly want an alternative for our upcoming midterm exams, where nearly, in some cases have more than hundreds of students seated in a closed room for 2 to 3 hours.

Many McGill classrooms and exams qualify for this ban as well as students who traveled abroad qualify for the 14-day self-isolation. \n\nEven though we are slightly disappointed in how McGill is currently dealing with the situation, it is not too late to act yet, and we still want to be proud of our university.\n\nMcGill, being one the best universities of Canada should be a role model, a leader for others to learn. \n\nHence, I am asking on behalf of all McGillians for McGill University to suspend in-person classes, move to online learning platforms, and find alternatives to exams. \n\nThank you.""', ""/u/brianthelionn\n\nUpdates!!!!\n\n1.

But, given the trends, I\'m severely disappointed with Canada\'s and McGill\'s response to COVID-19. There is, at the very least, a strong precedent that current containment efforts in Canada will also fail, leading to community spread. That\'s a scary thought, even if the average incubation period is a conservative number of days. In fact, it would definitely not be a dubious assumption to take that possibility as a given at this point. Since any uncontrolled growth of a population (including viruses) is exponential in nature, promoting slightly stricter safety measures only when a sudden surge of cases cluster around us may not be sufficient to slow down the spread significantly. For all we know, nothing less than the harsh containment efforts in the East can possibly slow down the spread enough to allow more recoveries than infections, and I highly doubt most of those measures are possible to implement here in North America. \n\nGiven the trends, Canada and McGill University SHOULD promote remote work, much like Princeton University is doing now. \nhttps://www.princeton.edu/news/2020/03/09/updated-policies-and-guidance-covid-19\n\nOur community needs to go above and beyond what\'s being recommended right now if we want prevention or even alleviate the almost certain damage control that needs to be done in the coming weeks.

1696525701.0,Speaking Our Minds at McGill," I'm a liberal Poli Sci student. I've written this post because I don't feel like I can speak my mind at McGill. 

What I've realized is that there is a lot of dogmatism on this campus, particularly concerning issues of social justice. Critiquing any progressive ideas can prompt accusations of bigotry, insensitivity, or even violence. It's easy not to notice this dogmatism because dissent has been discouraged, making some ideas about social justice appear self-evident. 

To be clear, I'm not a far-right wingnut. I'm a democratic socialist who wants an end to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. But I'm also alarmed by the stifling intellectual environment surrounding social justice at McGill. Enforcing ideological purity by shaming dissenters is something I'd expect to come from the far-right, not left-wing McGillians. 

All of the unproductive behaviours I will identify in this post are things I have been personally guilty of. By writing this post, I hope to draw attention to a problem I am partly responsible for.

I've spoken to many left-wing McGillians who feel they can't speak freely about certain progressive ideas, for fear of being labeled bigots. Here are some examples:

* Women who think that aspects of the MeToo movement are overblown or unproductive
* Professors who think that progressive ideas about mental health have created a culture of self-victimization and learned helplessness
* Black students who disagree with elements of recent anti-racist ideas; feel uncomfortable around many progressive white students because they try to acknowledge blackness instead of acting colourblind
* Queer students who feel uncomfortable in the LGBTQ+ movement because of its lack of ideological diversity and expectations surrounding dress, appearance, and tone of voice
* Students who have experienced rape, sexual assault who think that the current approach to sexual violence worsens mental health outcomes
* Science students who are alarmed by the anti-scientific attitudes of some left-wing McGillians, who deny any scientific facts that could potentially be abused for right-wing purposes (such as existence of human nature and innate aggregate sex differences between men and women)
* Liberal students and professors who are concerned about the state of free speech on campuses, but don't want to be seen as right-wingers

These people only shared their views after I made it clear that I wouldn't shame them for their opinions. By approaching political conversations more openly, I realized that many left-wing McGillians disagree with certain progressive ideas, but don't feel comfortable saying so. 

All of this is bad for three reasons. Firstly, we need open discourse in order to expand our minds. Listening to the people who disagree with us, instead of assuming they are bigots because we don't like their views, is a great way to sharpen our political thinking. A broadened perspective is one of the main rewards of a university education, but the current intellectual environment is robbing many of us of this benefit.

Secondly, freedom of speech is important in itself. It's necessary for democracy and good citizenship. How can we properly debate the social and political issues that affect our society if we routinely shame dissenters? Many of the ideas that we consider fundamental to the wellbeing of our society now were controversial a short time ago. 

Finally, closed intellectual environments harm social justice movements, in two ways. Firstly, shutting down dissent alienates potential allies. Shaming others for disagreeing with us is profoundly obnoxious. It communicates moral arrogance and makes others feel unheard and aggrieved. There is a reason the far-right has seized on the issue of free speech on campuses. They know that our approach to speech we disagree with is deeply unpopular.

Secondly, treating progressive ideas as sacrosanct allows bad ideas to flourish, undermining the efficacy of social justice activism. Activists in this environment become less capable of communicating effectively with the public, since their ideas are tailored to people who already agree with them.

I'm confident that leaving space for disagreement would raise the quality of discourse, broaden the minds of students, and strengthen social justice activism. Restoring intellectual openness would benefit all of us. Let's create a campus where we can speak our minds. ","[""I agree with you, and I'm happy you're speaking out about this. University campuses should be a space where ideas can be freely discussed, even if some questions make certain people uncomfortable.\n\nUniversity is supposed to turn us into more critical thinkers and stronger debaters. This is impossible if we aren't allowed to speak our minds or if we're never exposed to opinions that go against our own."", ""As a science student, I don't really have any particular alarm about the 'anti-scientific' attitudes of people who promote equality between genders or the inclusion of trans people in society. Just my two cents. As a woman in math I actually encounter people who hold bigoted beliefs about the ability of women to do serious intellectual work in the sciences.\n\nDo I agree we all deserve respect when we share political opinions, if we speak in good faith? Sure. But some ideas are bad. Some ideas are wrong, factually incorrect, or morally derelict and deserve to be called out as such."", ""There are a lot of the points you are making that I agree with, but I think it comes off a bit idealistic to identify a problem and suggest, as a solution, to just ''not do this'', because I think it skips over the *reason* why some progressive people in progressive environments can react poorly to things that an optimistic mind would perceive as a simple question, or mildly dissenting opinion.\n\nI've spent over 10 years at McGill and I've had some time to think about *why* these reactions happen and my opinion is that a large contributor is concern trolling fatigue. It's totally possible that, for example, someone expressing concern about a limit of the MeToo movement (like say, one single instance of an accusation that is later demonstrated to be untrue), is doing so in the hope of being constructive, open-minded and honest.\n\nUnfortunately, for people who have spent some time interacting with non-progressive people, a vast majority of the time these comments end up coming from people who are *pretending* to care about the issues you are raising, but really are just pushing a standard conservative agenda, or looking to satisfy their personal reactionary feelings.\n\nAnd while it would obviously be better to always keep an open mind and always assume that people raising these issues are doing so earnestly, when you encounter enough concern trolling or JAQing eventually it builds up a fatigue and it just becomes difficult to keep this very optimistic view that the person is being constructive and honest, even though it would obviously be better if everyone could be perfect and always assume the best and never overreact.\n\nUltimately I've come to accept that with the world outside the campus being dominated by pretty right-learning media (and often pretty right leaning local or national governements these days, although obviously that's not everywhere), people are just... tired. And it's that tiredness that leads progressive minded people to look for university campuses as a space that is devoid of, say, the same transphobic rhetoric that gets constantly spewed by, say, American conservative politicians.\n\nAnd yeah the result may be that people at McGill will not always react well to someone trying to have an open minded discussion about the links between anatomy and assigned gender at birth, and yeah that does have side effects that are not ideal, but I think when you try to understand *why* that is it becomes easier to focus on the fact that in the vast majority of people it ultimately comes from a good place, and while it would be ideal if we were collectively more welcoming to dissenting opinions, I try to be understanding of people who are just too tired to deal with not knowing whether it's concern trolling *again*."", 'Out of curiosity could you elaborate on “Students who have experienced rape, sexual assault who think that the current approach to sexual violence worsens mental health outcomes”?

I’m just saying that if people say something that a person disagrees with and is unable to actually discuss the matter without calling the other person ‘crazy, etc’, then we are just ending up with a society of stubborn people. \n\nI always try to watch videos from people both ‘right-wing’ and ‘left-wing’ in order to be well rounded and just hear both sides of an argument.

As such, boys tend to fall behind academically compared to their female peers.

I didn\'t think I needed the /s, but maybe I did.\n\nI never said that Adam Smith is responsible for all deaths due to capitalism, nor did I say that Karl Marx was responsible for all deaths due to communism. The top of your second paragraph is exactly my point; Marx, Smith, and Rand are all philosophers that you may or may not agree with. Hitler was a genocidal, racist, warmongering despot. Idolizing *any* of the philosophers, whichever one you agree with, is absolutely nothing like idolizing Hitler.\n\nIf you still disagree, I want you to specifically point out the ""idiotic logic"" from my comment.', '>I\'m sorry but I\'ll hate any person who tolerates a regime like the USSR any day.  And yes, it is ironic that often the most well off and privileged are the ones okay with handwaving millions of deaths. Your sensitivity indicates you are hurt by me saying a bloodthirsty dictator who killed millions should not be revered so openly in a class. Imagine I said I hated Palestine and have a shrine to Bibi Netanyahu? Is that a better comparison? Why are radical socialists allowed to openly profess murderous ideologies? Because they also have free housing and guaranteed jobs as carrots?\n\nIdk what you\'re butthurt about and it\'s hard to understand what your rant is other than ""socialists bad"". Good day 👍', '> And yeah, generally in activist communities (which the entire LGBTQ+ community is not, but QM and other similar groups are) jokes punching up are accepted with good humour.\n\nThe people who didn\'t accept the jokes in good humour aren\'t there because they *weren\'t* in good humour. They fucking left. \n\nIf it were a ""harmless rib"" as you say, where are all the gay cis looking people in QM? Oh right. They left. Because it isn\'t ""punching up,"" it\'s literally just bullying people for their appearance and outward presentation. So inclusive of you. Very impressive logic. \n\n> I mean that white, cis, gay men have always been the public face of the LGBTQ+ community, despite other members, notably (but not exclusively) trans women of colour both contributing more to the genesis of the pride movement and experiencing more violence and oppression.\n\nSo you mean that the time my boyfriend and I nearly got jumped for holding hands isn\'t enough oppression for you? Or being called ""faggot"" over and over while in highschool because I was the only person out in grade 9. Is that enough oppression for you? Or being handed biblical scriptures by people near the gay village for holding hands? Or having to jump a fence to get away from the people chasing us? Is that enough oppression for you?\n\n \n\nWhat about having counselors in QM not wanting me to share the room number of their offices to at risk Muslim guys who were on Grindr and terrified about being *beheaded* if they came back to their home country? Is that enough for you? Or for white cis looking Christian guys who are *terrified* of their parents figuring out and disowning them financially, is that enough oppression for you? Are they not queer presenting enough for you? \n\nI knew someone who got beaten so severely by homophobic family that he couldn\'t play the trumpet anymore, so he had to change his music major halfway through his degree. ""Cis white gay"" and that\'s what he went through. \n\nWhite, cis gay men like me have worked hard to uphold the rights of the wider gay community, and for the rights of transpeople. I tried to work for the wider McGill queer community by joining QM. Being treated like shit by our own community as if getting oppressed is some kind of twisted race is incredibly fucked up. You are part of the problem. Be better.', 'There’s very few actual trans people.

No because that’s ridiculous and clearly dehumanizing. \n\nI think the “majority” of people don’t understand trans identity - they cannot relate to gender dysmorphia and therefore they don’t ‘get it’. But just because you don’t understand or relate to something does not mean that you need to oppose it… if you don’t understand trans people that’s fine.

* you’re struggling to make friends because of your refusal to compromise your values or because... zoom uni
* you were not able to participate in overhyped campus events because you had to work (pre-COVID)
* your university experience is not what you expected it to be or like the movies make it look like it's supposed to be
* you’re battling with your mental health right now
* you've had to take some time off school to take care of yourself or someone you love
* you hate your program or you didn’t graduate with a degree in your program of choice
* it took you a bit longer than your peers to graduate 
* you’re not a fan of zoom university
* you are having a good time at uni, but just don’t have the pictures or instagram posts to prove it
* even pre-COVID, you really just wanted the degree. not the parties, not the stereotypical unhealthy lifestyle, just the degree.
* you’re giving uni your best, but still haven’t found your passion or your purpose
* you feel FOMO because you are doing your bit to stay safe and not put others at risk during this pandemic 
* you’re giving it your best, but still haven’t found an internship or a job
* you’re giving your studies your best, but your GPA doesn’t reflect it
* you’ve found out that a lot of your thoughts, beliefs and perspectives on certain issues are unpopular and sometimes you find yourself in a lonely fight for the things that matter to you
* you feel out of place with other students of the same age, race, or nationality as you
* you didn’t fall in love with your city like others did or didn’t even get to experience the city this semester
* you’ve changed your major like 5 times
* you've outgrown your friends
* zoom uni made you realize you had more acquaintances than friends
* you’re older/younger than most people in your program
* zoom uni has you feeling disconnected from the university life
* this finals season feels particularly scary and uncertain

Does that mean no more 4a7?', 'Very interesting', 'That makes sense, but still why the disproportionate growth in these positions relative to faculty or other staff?', 'no, this is explicitly talking about upper admin management. You can see the salaries for department admin like Student Affairs and even at the management level (as in the AO manager of a whole department) these full-time salaries on average cap at ~80k… and that’s after 30 years in a position. \n\nyour department admin are not being over-paid in any way shape or form lol. The upper admin in James are the ones who do not post their salaries anywhere or offer any transparency about their pay because that is where the inflation has been.', 'Yeah, these people aren’t always who I would consider « upper management « . It would be interesting to see the spread of salaries within mpex employees, and how that contrasts with munaca salary growth. In my faculty there are only a handful of manager/director level mpex staff that would appear in this graph, meanwhile there are almost as many mpex as munaca staff.\xa0', 'It does not include MUNACA, MUNASA only', 'This is a bit silly. First, there are international students on campus, including those from areas with very contentious political issues that are affecting them and their families. So there is, in fact, a “nexus to campus” for these issues. Second, it’s just not true that SSMU only does geopolitics. You can argue they do too much of that, but what’s gerts? What’s free menstrual products in every bathroom on campus? What’s activities night? Saying SSMU only acts in relation to international conflicts is kinda funny, but also hyperbolic to the point of being unhelpful. \n\nIf you want SSMU to focus more on issues impacting workers and students on campus, like McGill’s ruthless austerity kick, then go talk to ppl about those issues. Get off Reddit and start organizing with peers! There is no one but McGill undergrads who are capable of reorganizing the SSMU to be more aligned with our collective needs. We cannot continue to wait for a better student union to fall out of the sky while we all keep shitting on it (not for no reason, to be clear) and not making anything better.', 'If the MOA is not renewed, money will not go directly from students to SSMU. Hence, ssmu will need to find a different way to get its money and keep up the activities.', 'I think one phenomenon here is that often munaca employees move into mpex jobs, and theres a perception that the only way to grow your salary is to move into one of these positions. So much so that munaca jobs often get converted into munasa/mpex ones, and then that employee experiences growth. Ive heard of multiple stories where a supervisor feels bad for a munaca persons low salary, and gets them a raise by converting that position into mpex.\n\nThis is a problem for the union as it effectively shrinks if high performers are always being siphoned out of the union into mpex roles. Ideally a much larger amount of admin staff should be unionized, which we see at concordia. Im sad to no longer be in the union but theres so little growth in munaca roles. Its ridiculous how many positions are mpex when equivalent roles are unionized at other universities and in the public sector.\n\nThough it’s not clear to me who is in what group in this graph. I wish it specified mpex tiers! I myself night be considered ‘upper’ which would be silly haha', ""The key thing about this graph is that it shows salary 'mass' and not average salary. Salary mass is the total amount of money spent in an area.\n\nNext, it shows how much of an increase an area has changed over time, instead of total spending in an area. \n\nLast, management positions at McGill typically consist of roles that you would not call a 'manager', they're usually all the roles that don't fall neatly into faculty or administrative staff. \n\nTo sum it all up, this graph can be explained by saying that the school has been hiring more staff to work at the school that aren't faculty or admin staff. The graph is trying to present this data as that the folks in higher admin are giving themselves cushy raises but if that's the case then a better way to do this would just be to show the % change in salary over time instead using these unnecessary categories."", ""The graph is about the total salary mass at the whole university by job category. An increasing \\*number\\* of mpex jobs, even if that's just because jobs get reclassified or (as mentioned elsewhere on the thread) because the same people get promoted-in-place to mpex, leads to that salary mass increasing. Has nothing to do with people being overpaid."", ""That's what I said."", ""Lol, the SSMU literally provides y'all with health insurance, too. All these people celebrating punitive action by the university against it for pursuing a mandate given to it by it's membership, which is literally what the organization is supposed to do, are so myopic. Everyone love complaining about how the SSMU doesn't represent their interests, but they don't, you know, actually do anything themselves, and expect that it should just magically be done? If they don't like it, the answer, rather than moaning about it on reddit, is to have some goddamn agency on their own part, and get involved in building the kind of student politics they want to see, rather than just be mad about how those student politics instead reflect the ideals of the people who actually care enough to put the work in and gain the required support from the student body."", ""That's not quite true... According to provincial.laws on worker and student unions, McGill is not allowed to cease providing SSMU it's due funding. What the termination of the MoA entails, apparently, is just the SSMU wouldn't be affiliated directly to the uni or smthg."", 'This interpretation makes no sense. The only thing that would justify hiring more ""management"" is an increase in enrollment, which there was of 8% or so during that period. So your explanation that they school may have just hired more ""management"" during this period does not work (and certainly is not justifiable) as this would mean they doubled if not tripled the number of people ij ""management"" for an 8% increase in enrollment ??\n\nIt cannot be a coincidence that the president salary between 2013 and 2022 was 150%... in all likelyhood 2013-2024 is strangely close to 180%..\n\nOn the other hand, teaching and research increased about 40%. Take into account inflation 30% or so during this period you are left with 10%. Now, you would not expect an  8% of increase in enrollment to translate into 8% more professors or lecturers, maybe 2% ? So if they increased the amount for researchers(affiliated for instance) which you would expect, in all likelyhood, profs lecturers  etc get paid at most a tad more than before... and possibly less than before if you take into account inflation.', ""I don't think that's likely to be the case, though, unless the argument is something like instead of management numbers growing, teaching, research, and support staff numbers are shrinking. For management to be... you know, management, there have to be less of them than the population of managed employees, right? Even if this is the narrowing of ratios, is that something that could really explain such a large and steadily increasing divergence? Is this university simply drowning in bureaucracts and no-one has noticed enough to point that out yet? Granted, I don't know much about organizational/institutional management or whatever, but that seems unlikely, unless I'm reading everything wrong here, which is certainly possible as well."", 'Where is the evidence that there has been an increase of MPEX jobs and that this increase can explain the incredible difference between management salary mass increases and the increases of everyone else’s salary mass? It’s not unreasonable what you’re saying, not by any means, but I need some kind of evidence before I’m willing to give admin the benefit of the doubt on this one. They have the information. Why aren’t they sharing it?', ""My bad, you're definitely right 52-54 https://www.legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/document/cs/a-3.01"", ""There's nothing about ratios in this graph. This graph is designed to convince you there is, but there isn't. 10 years ago very few staff were in the mpex category and now more staff get categorized as mpex. This graph is an artifact of the fact that an underutilized junk drawer job category is now used more. Also note that the vast majority of mpex staff don't manage anyone - they provide direct services to students, they just aren't part of the union and are therefore put in the mpex junk drawer."", ""I see. So are you saying that this is largely a result of a shift of some workers being classified as support staff to being classified as administrative staff? If that's the case, why doesn't the salary mass for support staff drop, and if it's not, does that mean there's a fourth category that isn't being represented here? It seems to me that if the overall amount of money being disbursed via salaries in this category has doubled, then if it's not the case that this is driven by salary increases but just re-shufflings, that change should be inversely observable elsewhere, shouldn't it?"", ""Thanks, this is a good question (my use of caps is just to highlight the key points of what I'm getting at): \n\nWe don't see a decrease within the other categories because the graph shows the percentage change WITHIN the category. Overtime all 3 groups go up because the graph does not depict the ratio on how money is distributed BETWEEN the three groups. Everyone's salary has gone up over the last 10 years AND new positions have been added that did not get classified as faculty or support staff. \n\nThe second thing is that if 1 of the categories starts small (mpex) then it's easy to show a large increase with a minor change. A decade ago mpex really was an outlier category and it's become more and more common for jobs to be classified in this group (the 'excluded' part of mpex does a lot of heavy lifting).\n\nIf something was 1% of the salary mass a 10 years ago and it's now 2% of the current salary mass then that's a 100% increase in salary mass.\n\nIf something was 50% of the salary mass 10 years ago and it's now it's 60% of the current salary mass that's only an increase of salary mass of 20%. Even though this has gone up 10 points (vs 1 point) it seems like a smaller number because more of an increase is needed to show an effect.\n\nWhat your describing looking for is what the graph SHOULD be showing to make it's point - it should show how much of the TOTAL salary mass goes towards each group has changed over time. Or it should show the change in AVERAGE SALARY of a staff member in each of those three roles. It doesn't, likely because that graph wouldn't be as shocking. \n\nAll in all, my point is that this is a graph designed to be needlessly obtuse so people feel like there's outrageous financial mismanagement at the school. I mean, this graph came as part of an email that deliberately ignores the fact that the school is being pilfered by the provincial government during a time when international student quotas (the major driver in how the school funds itself) have been reduced."", 'https://preview.redd.it/dpht3r4qtwte1.png?width=3399&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6a1ee5bf00025b015862dd338aff6b546d2f873\n\nHere is one of the graphs you are looking for, and it shows just what was inferred from the other one: management salary mass is going up, and the salary mass of support staff and teaching and research staff is, correspondingly, decreasing. It is only possible to make this graph because of the data McGill is mandated to report to the government.\n\nIt is possible without much effort to make graphs that would show, for example, that these trends are not explained by upper administration lining their own pockets at the expense of everybody else, and that they are the result of an increase in the number of MPEX positions that are, on average, being paid similarly to the union jobs they supplanted. Neither the unions nor the public nor the government have access to that data, only McGill does, and as of yet I have seen McGill distributing no such graph.', 'Thanks for the explanation!']",508

1604970789.0,Interest in petition for a longer winter break,"I'm putting this here to see how many students/profs would be willing to sign a formal petition in order to get a longer winter break this year.

Other universities across the provinces have found ways to lengthen their winter break for this year, while ours is going to last 12 days, which is a whole 4 days SHORTER than last year. 

This is mainly due to the fact that the admin makes their calendar 3-4 years in advance (which is also why it's so hard to get a fall reading week). They evidently couldn't plan for a whole ass pandemic then, but with how slow things have been moving admin-wise it's pretty certain nothing's gonna change if we don't do something. Exceptional times that calls for exceptional student mobilization. 

The SSMU will be meeting the Deputy Provost of Student Life and Learning later this week to bring this issue forward, but a petition is still a good idea and would definitely help bring more attention to this.

1614090899.0,McGill will return to in-person teaching beginning in Fall 2021,"Dear members of the McGill community,
As we enter the final weeks of an extraordinary academic year, questions have naturally been raised about plans for 2021-2022.  We write to confirm that McGill will return to in-person teaching beginning in Fall 2021. While some components of courses will harness the pedagogical benefits of online teaching, students and teaching staff should plan for a return to more regular rhythms of on-campus academic activity by September. With this in mind, student residences will be open in Fall 2021 with the usual guarantee of accommodation to all eligible first-year students who request it. We will likewise continue to develop plans for a progressive return to on-campus work for administrative and support staff, with the goal of achieving a regular presence by September 2021.
 
The health and wellbeing of our community will of course remain a top priority, and all necessary health and safety measures will continue to be implemented to ensure that our campuses remain safe places to learn and to work in the coming year. While the evolution of the public health situation in Quebec cannot be known with certainty, we are confident in our collective capacity to deliver academic programs and university services in a way that meets the standards of excellence expected of McGill University while continuing to ensure the safety of our community.
 
We appreciate that you will have questions in the coming weeks and months and we commit to providing regular updates as we prepare for a return to on-campus activity.
 
With best wishes,

1640488917.0,I graduated McGill with a 2.34 GPA! AMA,"Hi fellow McGillians,

During my ten semesters at McGill, I struggled A LOT - mental health issues, interpersonal issues, imposter syndrome... you name it. As you can see in [the graph here](https://imgur.com/HRMb50c) (made for your amusement), I finished my first semester at McGill with a 0.58 term GPA. I went through the readmission process twice, failed/incompleted more than 10 courses, and spent many semesters on academic probation. After five years, I barely graduated by the skin of my teeth.

I wanted to make this post to remind fellow struggling students that there is more to life than a perfect GPA. No, I likely won't be able to go to grad school in the near future, but I managed to land an interesting job in my field of study that pays well and offers a relatively good work-life balance. Not everyone at McGill is going to go to the ivies for grad school, and that is okay.

I never told a single person just how badly I was fucking up, and felt so alone/guilty throughout my  whole tenure at McGill. I'm making this post to enable an open dialogue for students that don't feel they're succeeding at McGill. I'm proof that there is more to life than your undergrad GPA. Feel free to ask me anything - tips on how to pick yourself up, best study spots, how to get a job with a shitty GPA - I'm an open book (or PM me!).

Everyone says it, but finding interesting internships/club experience/volunteer work while still in undergrad/right after graduation was key to having something to speak about outside of school when applying for full-time work. Despite my GPA, I managed to do three internships while at McGill. My best advice for finding internships would be to look for unique opportunities at smaller firms that are less likely to be competitive than say, a summer associateship at McKinsey (thus, less less likely to use GPA as a way to differentiate/quantify candidates). When applying for my first internship, I relied heavily on the McGill brand and the perceived value of a McGill degree. Once I had one under my belt, I felt more comfortable applying for more competitive internships.\n\n2. When looking for work, I applied the same logic used in finding an internship. I didn't waste my time applying to the big names in consulting work because I felt my GPA would disqualify me for any of their recent graduate programs. Instead, I targeted my search toward smaller/mid-size firms that would likely be less competitive and less likely to ask about GPA. I tailored my resume and cover letter to each specific job. One great resource I read during this process was a book called Entry Level Boss by Alexa Shoen (recommended by someone on this subreddit!). I found her book to be a great guide for the process.  In interviews, I had internship and other work experience to talk about, and on top of that, the perceived value of a McGill degree. I think I only applied to like 5 jobs and managed to get two offers from that.\n\nBest of luck to you. Happy to expand on specifics if there's anything else I can add insight on."", ""Thank you. I didn't tell anyone because I just didn't have the skills to be vulnerable about not succeeding. As I'm sure many McGill students can relate to, I'd never really struggled with school prior to attending McGill, and I'm a bit of a perfectionist. I didn't want to let down all my support systems that were so proud of me for taking on the challenge. In hindsight, I wish I'd told someone instead of bottling it up. I think perhaps I could have focused more about succeeding in the future instead of dwelling on the past. Cheers!"", ""I feel you, I felt like an alien during my first year at McGill. Though that feeling never completely went away during my studies, I think reminding myself that I was accepted to the school just like everyone else helped. If you have the resources, I'd also recommend really putting in hard work next semester/next year and just do all the necessary readings/exercises for your courses. After being put on academic probation after my first year, I probably doubled the amount of time I spent studying/prepping for lectures in my second year.  I found that being prepared for my lectures, knowing what the professor is talking about in lecture, and being able to answer questions posed by the prof really helped me feel less like an imposter. Feel free to PM if you'd like to talk more. Cheers!"", ""Don't list it on your CV and I bet it never gets brought up."", ""Depends on the job. Some employers definitely do care. I also studied econ, and was looking for work in consulting after graduation. I didn't waste my time applying for any recent grad program in consulting (like Bain or McKinsey) because they make it quite clear they use GPA as a metric for their applicants. I'd recommend applying to smaller/boutique firms. I think in general employers don't care about GPA - they barely even care that you went to college. From what I've heard, once you manage to get your foot in the door somewhere and get some full-time experience, your GPA really isn't even a discussion for subsequent job interviews. Seems employers are much more interested in experience and skills development."", "">I've never been asked for my GPA. I have 10 years +  in clinical research.

1718728817.0,Feeling deeply let down by the pro-Palestinian protestors,"I just want to say that I feel incredibly let down by the pro-Palestinian groups on campus. I’m an Arab student here at McGill, so I practically grew up with this conflict and have been hearing about it my whole life. I have childhood friends who lost tens of family members in the past months. 

I’m very pro-Palestine, but I’m not in the camp of people who seem to dominate these campus shenanigans who think Israel should cease to exist. I don’t agree with violence, and frankly I do condemn Hamas but I also condemn the Israeli government the quite terroristic tactics that the IDF has been engaged in. Given this, I find it really disheartening how the encampment/SPHR/whoever else is involved took a violent and radical turn in the recent weeks. I feel like all this does is turn people away from the pro-Palestine cause, and associate us arabs with violence and terrorists (as if we aren’t already portrayed as terrorists here). 

I genuinely wish the encampment remained peaceful like in the start, as I think the popular sentiment was really in favour of them, and I think did much more for the pro Palestinian movement than the shitshow that’s been happening now. Everyone was on board with how ridiculous deep’s emails were about the encampment, as it was peaceful, but now that’s not the case anymore. I just don’t see why things like occupying James admin, that poster, disrupting grad photos, etc. were necessary. Like what were they thinking, how on earth would this help the pro-Palestine movement? A peaceful protest, explaining the pro-Palestine view, could’ve kept a moral high ground, and might have convinced more people to care and support Palestinians. 

I also understand that this is a last resort for student groups, as a democratic vote was held, there was even a hunger strike, many protests, and the start of the encampment was peaceful, so I’ve heard the argument that this is a move of desperation but I still maintain that this is not the right way. I guess I’m posting as a rant, but also to show that there do exist pro-Palestine people on campus who really dislike what SPHR/the encampment has been up to. Can anyone else relate?

Edit: added paragraph breaks ","['[deleted]', ""Amen to that. I'm 100% for the end of the war, entirely critical of Netanhayu, and think that Palestinians should receive statehood, reparations, and significantly more land than they currently possess. I think that Israel should exist (if they didn't 9 million people would immediately get ethnically cleansed) but I'm absolutely critical of Israel's behaviour. \n\nThe behaviour of the SPHR and the encampment protesters is a huge let down. They are letting down the Pro-Palestine cause through their dogmatism and wingnuttery. They are making it appear as if we are radicals and extremists for wanting an end to the war. \n\nSometimes I wish we could start a pro-Palestine organization for reasonable people who don't defend Hamas and who don't want the destruction of Israel. Maybe we could create a student organization that is geared towards condemning the war and donating to Palestinian civilians without tolerating insane behaviour."", 'Yeah the encampment was peaceful until it wasn’t. It’s a major let down.', 'Amen to that. SPHR is run by a bunch of noobs.', 'There are a million things I could say, but, in lieu of writing a book, I\'ll just make a few points — apologies for their disjointedness.\n\n***A little bit on the protests and protest groups in general***\n\n(*There\'s no way I could deliver a full view of all of this in one post*)\n\nFirst, I have to distinguish between peaceful protest and protest expressing pro-peace views. A protest can be *hateful* while being nonviolent, i.e., peaceful. The encampment (and pro-Palestine protests in general) have had a mix of pro-peace and extremist people since the beginning. There have always been people who have celebrated October 7 (including SPHR, but they\'re not even the most radical or outspoken), as well as people in Hamas-related apparel, often depicting Abu Obaida, the spokesman of the al-Qassam Brigades (Hamas\' military wing).The people with the most extreme views are usually the most dedicated, so of course they show up.\n\nMore generally, I find that terms like ""pro-Palestinian,"" ""pro-Israeli,"" ""Zionist"" and ""anti-Zionist"" can be unhelpful, because people frequently disagree on their substantive meaning. There are people for whom being ""pro-Palestinian"" means sympathizing with civilians and wanting the violence to end; there are others for whom it means supporting Hamas and wanting a thousand more October 7 attacks. (Ditto for definitions of ""Zionism"" and ""pro-Israeli."") These terminological problems often inflame tensions and create misunderstandings — and that can sometimes prevent reasonable people from working together, unfortunately.\n\nMany people are pro-Palestinian in the sense that you are — wanting Palestinians to have decent lives — but sadly end up marching alongside extremists with a totally different worldview, often without even knowing it. (Aside: to me, Hamas is the furthest thing from pro-Palestinian; they would rather have Palestinian civilians die as martyrs for the cause rather than be allowed to live a decent life. It\'s stunning to me that some people claim they are ""anti-war"" while supporting Hamas.)\n\nFor others, an extremist pro-violence viewpoint appeals to them in much the same way violent video games appeal to people. We are sitting here in one of the safest places in the world — nobody going out and proclaiming their support for violence an ocean away is actually putting themselves in real danger. These cosplay revolutionaries have totally different attitudes from the vast majority of people I\'ve met for whom anything real has ever been at stake.\n\n***On the encampment specifically***\n\nComing back the encampment, I am going to disagree with you a bit. I\'ve never been in favor of the encampment, but it has nothing to do with their viewpoints (even though I find the extremist viewpoints repulsive). And, as much as the recent fliers may have been in bad taste, they are, as far as I\'m concerned, very much protected by any reasonable standard of freedom of speech. It would be wrong to dismantle the encampment *because of this flier*. As badly as I think it reflects on those who created it, distributing that flier is anyone\'s right. Handing out a picture of people with machine guns isn\'t the same thing as *doing* terrorism — even if it implies a viewpoint with which I disagree very much.\n\nMy problem with the encampment has nothing to do with anyone\'s viewpoints (whether reasonable or extremist). The argument that the encampment people have made is that they, as members of the public, have the right to peacefully occupy McGill\'s grounds for as long as they want (as long as they do so while expressive political speech of some kind). But the real goal of the encampment is, essentially, to cause direct financial damage to McGill by preventing them from using their property. The cost of moving convocation ceremonies, for instance, was about $700,000. This direct financial damage resulting from McGill\'s inability to use its own property is the distinction between a march and an encampment.\n\nHowever, if we take the freedom of speech argument seriously, then, for example, [MQF](https://quebecfrancais.org/) members could occupy McGill indefinitely until it agreed to become an exclusively French-speaking university. I don\'t imagine most McGill students would support free speech for *those* protestors. Nor would I. By contrast, I fully support people\'s right to express viewpoints by marching or having other similar protests — and this includes people with viewpoints of which I strongly disapprove. The freedom of speech is only worth anything insofar as much as it protects *highly unpopular* speech, not just whatever I happen to agree with. I just don\'t think should include the right to coerce a university (or similar body) into making a decision by preventing them from using their property. (I suppose we\'ll see what the courts say.)\n\nI also personally think McGill made a mistake by attempting to ""negotiate"" with the encampment in the first place. For one, I think that sets a bad precedent for future encampments on any other issue. But more than that, there was never anyone with whom to negotiate (since the encampment has never had a single viewpoint/movement behind it), and at least some elements of the encampment could never possibly be satisfied.\n\nI feel that most people at McGill who have expressed support for the encampment do so only because they happen to agree with (their perception of) the protestors\' views, rather than a commitment to freedom of speech as a principle (as much as this was mentioned as rhetorically important). As the (perceived) tone of the encampment became more extremist, more people felt alienated by it. Popular support for the encampment might have also been, to some extent, influenced by kneejerk thinking that often is employed in discussions about emotionally powerful issues such as this one. ""You don\'t support the encampment? So you hate Palestinians, then?"" This is the same kind of thinking that can fuel online slacktivism (which is very common in student movements in general). And that gets messy in a situation like this where some bad people have associated themselves with both sides of the conflict. This is also part of why people can be dragged into unwittingly standing alongside and ""sanewashing"" extremists — they are told to not be critical of people who are ""on their side.""\n\nIf we care about our morals, we do need to take choosing our political allies and positions seriously. Finally, I fully agree that any desirable future requires Palestinians and Israelis to coexist peacefully and live their lives with the dignity and safety that everyone deserves. That goal won\'t be easy to achieve, but it is a worthy one.', ""Forgive my cynicism, but I get the distinct impression that about half the people involved in the protests are there less because they have thought through the situation and truly feel that this is the best course of action (if they had, they wouldn't be calling for what amounts to the genocide of 9 million Jews (and I dont use that term lightly but that would be the effect of making an ethnic group stateless)) and more because they have a either a saviour complex or some version of guilt they are trying to appease. The second you lose the moral high ground it stops looking pro-palestine and starts looking pro-attention seeking. \n\nThat's why, despite supporting Palestine and Palestinians wholeheartedly (and find isreal's actions this past year to be entirely reprehensible and vile), I cannot find it in me to support the current encampments."", 'Im curious OP, what was your position re:SPHR McGill when they celebrated the Oct. 7th attacks. Was that not already a ""radical turn"" to use your phrasing?\n\nI do agree with your post however on ""pro-palestine."" If you just don\'t want anymore people to die, want a peaceful solution and repatriation for the Palestinians in the West Bank etc., what do we even call ourselves?\n\nPersonally, I don\'t think that SPHR McGill was ever represented unfairly in these emails. They\'ve been like this from the very beginning. Ex. attack the ""save the hostages"" table at concordia and immediately post a bajillion insta stories gaslighting people into thinking it never happened and that they are being unfairly targeted...', 'Amen, these pro-Palestinian groups don’t help to bring both sides together. The unhinged support of terrorism and anti-semitism will always hold back these groups from bringing a peace deal. Israel’s 20 years of far right governments isn’t because they hate Palestinians, but because Hamas has brought an endless justification for a militaristic approach to the conflict.', ""Thank you for summing up my thoughts exactly! The only issue is that while the encampment was peaceful, McGill did nothing except try to spread fake news and try to get the cops to dismantle the encampment.

It's historical fact pretty much.\n\nIf you want, you can always go to the camp and speak with them, Im sure they'll listen to someone who is much closer to the conflict than they are.

You saw yourself that no matter what the protestors did, McGill wouldn’t try to negotiate in good faith. \n\nNot insulting you or trying to be obtuse, I just genuinely want to understand what else the protestors could do. \n\nYou have to remember that the goal of the protest is to get McGill to divest and boycott. Not to raise awareness about whats going on in Palestine. So seeing as that is the goal, what would be better than disruption?', ""I'm sorry but the peaceful approach is yet to make an ounce of a difference. At least this approach got them to the negotiation table.\n\nI'm not justifying their actions, just their perspective."", 'Please use paragraph breaks lmao', '[removed]', ""I think you're making the mistake of thinking that SPHR and the encampments goal is to make the pro-palestine viewpoint more popular, or raise support. This would be nice, but it is NOT the main goal of the encampment. The goal is to FORCE McGill to divest from Israeli apartheid, plain and simple. The things they are doing and posting are thus trying to make that goal a reality, not drum up more support. They already have a ton of support!

They are wielding that support to further an actual goal."", '>Reddit Mods\n\nThis better not be anti-/u/Thermidorien slander or imma throw hands', ""McGill alum here.

I’m referring to the encampment run by that whole group as “taking a radical turn” rather than SPHR, which in my eyes were discredited when they posted that celebration post. \n\n2. As for what happened at Concordia, I am not a Concordia student so I can’t know for sure what happened there, but according to neutral sources [for example here](https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.7023019) it seems like there are diverging perspectives on what happened, so it’s hard to say without knowing the truth. I’m happy to read more if you have more sources to share, I remember during this I was trying to see what happened from both pro Palestine and pro Israel sources. \n\n3.  As for McGill’s emails, I wasn’t referring to SPHR in particular being villainized but rather the whole collective of groups who are pro-Palestine on campus being villainized in the early days of the encampment.', 'I 100% agree that McGill has been vilifying the pro-Palestine movement on campus in general, which makes me upset since if they remained peaceful, more people would see through McGill’s relentless propaganda. I mean, the courts here saw through it twice and failed to grant McGill the injunctions they wanted. Now that they’ve messed up, they do have a point in some of their emails recently, and honestly I wouldn’t be surprised if McGill got the injunction this time around (I’m assuming they’re going to try again).', 'I mean a very similar case of protesting peacefully to get McGill to divest from the CU200 worked & McGill followed through with it…', 'But the way I see it, the escalation resulted in a lot of people in the McGill community disagreeing with the encampment (who may have been neutral or even for it before), and having less public support really hurts the pro-Palestinian cause. If there is a lot of buy-in from McGill students, profs, staff, collectively we could exert pressure on McGill admin to actually give a good deal, since they can’t alienate the vast majority of their community. But now that it seems like a lot of people in the McGill community are rightfully alienated by the encampment, so I feel like they have much less sway. \n\nSo to answer your question, if I were part of the encampment, I would remain peaceful. It’s hard for McGill to discredit the movement in their emails if there is nothing to call out. If people come by to chat I would explain my views, and if they disagree we can have a civil discussion. For example, if I were them I would not have disrupted graduation pictures, since honestly I don’t think that made anyone more sympathetic to Palestinians, people were just annoyed. I think this would have increased campus support for the pro-Palestine movement, and hopefully that places a greater pressure on McGill rather than small groups of students being violent. Also the encampment made it to local news a lot too, so if the encampment conducts itself in a good way, that’s good press for the movement in local news, and maybe people outside the McGill community would’ve put pressure on our politicians to do something, which would also help the cause.', 'I agree that there isn’t much they can do and it must be frustrating for them. However, part of the process of any kind of revolution is making allies. It takes a lot to enact any kind of change. Antagonizing the student body, the people that support the encampment the most was a terrible political move on their part.', ""the goal of the some members of the encampment is almost certainly to raise awareness. i've seen as many calls for ceasefire and more radicalized things as there are calls for divestment"", 'I thought they were in the negotiation room before the encampment got more violent and radical though? To me it feels like they lost a lot of public support, which I think really hurts the cause.', 'Gandhi and Martin Luther King both accomplished quite a lot through nonviolence.', ""downvote me all you want it's the truth and you all know it (and you're mad about it). the mcgill camp has proven to have the most backbone and solid principles of most of the ones we've seen in north america. they got the same concessions as everyone without dismantling the camp or caving into the administration's pressure. they're still facing repression and the threat of disciplinary actions but they got mcgill closer to divestment than anyone ever thought possible and i doubt their work is done! so again, you can all cry harder"", ""it's okay they're not wrong"", 'I just re-read my post, I retract the “SPHR taking a radical turn” part, it was not my intention to say they were fine before the encampments, my bad, they really fucked up with oct7 and the broken glass poster on the anniversary of Kristallnacht.', ""Dude... do you know how much violence was involved in the Indian revolution and the Civil rights movement? The establishment pushes the ahistorical notion that nonviolence is effective because that helps suppress political violence as a tool for social change.\n\nThe civil rights act WOULD NOT have happened if MLK jr. had not been flanked by Fred Hampton and the Black Panthers -- this is on top of the fact that MLK jr. himself had been beginning to embrace 1) revolutionary marxism and 2) the utility of political violence before he was assassinated. \n\nOf course, it also helps to remember that MLK jr. was regularly portrayed as heading a violent mob of uppity black people hellbent on destruction. Trying to upend the status-quo will ALWAYS be perceived as an act of violence to those who are invested in the status-quo, and they will scream from the rooftops about how violent a peaceful march of people (or a peaceful encampment on the lower field, to bring to convo back) is in order for the public to ignore legitimate concerns.\n\nI know a lot less about the Indian Revolution, but to suggest that Gandhi and his ilk didn't use violence to achieve freedom is easily disprovable.\n\nOppressors do not give up freedom, it has to be won. If you'd like a little reading I would suggest the book How to Blow Up a Pipeline by Andreas Malm, which details the huge importance and utility of political violence in basically every single struggle for social change throughout history (it also makes a good argument for it's use in fighting the climate crisis)."", 'I’m talking in the protestors particular case, not in all throughout history.', 'Omg sweetie no everyone hates u', ""Oh no they've gotten to you too 😞"", 'Ah thanks in that case I agree with you completely.', 'doesn’t matter lol they’re winning and the pro-palestine side is winning despite tremendous repression. “everyone” (but really just stupid bootlickers like you) also hated every single change-maker or revolutionary we admire today and i don’t think it bothered them too much. so for the third time, cry harder.\xa0', 'This ain’t it 😂', 'ok.\xa0', 'You really think a bunch of privileged ass kids in a university lawn, pissing everybody off and acting like brats in the eyes of everyone that isnt them is tantamount to revolutionary?

1744047927.0,McGill terminates its relationship with SSMU,"Well, I never expected it to actually happen. But it did. Any thoughts? I think it goes without saying that this is likely going to be disastrous for the undergraduate student body if SSMU doesn't compromise.

Transcript is as follows:

*Dear McGill students,*

*I write today to inform you that the University has made the difficult decision to terminate its current contractual relationship with the Students' Society of McGill University (SSMU). Under the terms of the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between McGill and the SSMU, either party is permitted to end the relationship with no fault assigned, provided that mediation is attempted beforehand. We will, of course, honour that process and engage in it in good faith.*

*That said, I want to be fully transparent with you about why we have taken this step and what it means for you.*

*Let me begin by acknowledging that the SSMU plays an important and historic role in representing undergraduate students at McGill. Many of its services and advocacy initiatives are deeply valued by the community, and several members of the SSMU’s leadership this year have worked hard, in good faith, with the University administration. They have demonstrated a sincere commitment to representing their peers and improving student life for all undergraduates.*

*However, the SSMU’s leadership has been neither unanimous nor explicit in dissociating itself from or rejecting groups without recognized status at McGill that endorse or engage in acts of vandalism, intimidation, and obstruction as forms of activism. We reject this, unequivocally. Protest is indeed part of university life—our policies and the law protect peaceful assembly and freedom of expression. But vandalism, obstruction, threats, and violence do not fall within these protections. They violate our collective values and our policies, and they damage the trust and safety of our community.*

*Last week, SSMU allowed and, at least tacitly, supported a three-day strike that further divided a campus community already deeply cleaved and hurting. The SSMU can and should have ruled the motion that led to the strike referendum as out of order given SSMU’s governing documents, but opted against this. The result was a campus environment in which dozens of classes were blocked or interrupted. Students and instructors were unable to teach or learn. Many felt threatened, intimidated, and unsafe. This culminated in an incident in which individuals smashed a glass office door using a fire hydrant filled with red paint. The paint was sprayed throughout the office while staff were inside. One staff member was hit directly.*

*Let me be clear: No one at McGill—no student, no staff member, no instructor or faculty member—should ever have to experience this at their place of work or study. This behaviour is unacceptable, and I denounce it in the strongest possible terms.*

*These tactics do nothing to support or advance the causes they purport to advance. They divide our community and threaten to foment hate against groups who are already vulnerable.*

*While the SSMU has since issued a statement reaffirming its commitment to peaceful protest and recognizing that some events during the strike turned violent, McGill University remains deeply concerned about the consequences of this strike. A commitment to peaceful protest must be demonstrated not just in words but in practice. The University will continue to prioritize the safety and well-being of all members of our community as we move forward.*

*I am aware that some in our community have viewed McGill's communications as conveying bias in favour of one group or another. I take these concerns seriously and have reflected on them carefully in writing to you today. My goal is not to silence dissent, but to affirm that all students—whatever their identity or politics—deserve to live, learn, and express themselves on a campus free of fear, harassment, or violence, where their dignity is respected.*

*As we move forward, the University will enter the mediation process with SSMU in the spirit of resolution. Should that process not allow us to sustain the MOA, we are fully committed to ensuring that students continue to have strong, democratic representation and uninterrupted access to critical services. The well-being and academic success of all our students will remain our foremost priority.*

*I will continue to keep you informed as we navigate this process. Thank you for your attention, and for your ongoing care for one another in these challenging times.*

*Sincerely,*

*Professor Angela Campbell*

*Interim Deputy Provost, Student Life and Learning*","['does anyone have more info about the fire hydrant?', 'can someone explain what this means?', ""Wondering what the impact on clubs will be -- might be a lot of finance uncertainty next year, if they're not able to get funding from students"", 'What’s the fire hydrant incident referring to?', 'Ok does anyone know what that means for us? Isn’t SSMU the group that provides us with clubs and various kinds of mental health care like the therapy dogs? Why is the SSMU even considered separate from McGill? Like what does this mean for our healthcare for international student? It just seems so stupid and weird to me that McGill takes this shit so seriously.', ""There is so, so much misinformation in this thread.\n\nBy Quebec law, student unions are legally recognized unions and have the right to levy funding, which the establishment is legally required to collect at registration. McGill has no right to deny funding, and the MoA is not the mechanism by which SSMU is granted the right to levy funding. \n\nHere is the relevant passage from the \\*Act respecting the accreditation and financing of students’ associations\\*:\n\n>[52.](https://www.legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/document/cs/a-3.01#se:52) To finance its activities, an accredited students’ association or students’ association alliance, by by-law approved by a majority of the students voting at a special meeting or referendum for that purpose, may fix an assessment payable by each student represented by the alliance.  \n[53.](https://www.legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/document/cs/a-3.01#se:53) Where the accredited students’ association or students’ association alliance so requests not later than 30 days before the first day for registration, the educational institution shall collect from each person at registration, the assessment established by the association or alliance.  \n[54.](https://www.legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/document/cs/a-3.01#se:54) Every person, in order to be registered at an educational institution where an accredited students’ association or students’ association alliance exists, shall pay the assessment established by the association or alliance, if contemplated by the accreditation.  \n[55.](https://www.legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/document/cs/a-3.01#se:55) The educational institution, within 30 days after the last day for registration, shall pay to the accredited students’ association or students’ association alliance entitled thereto the sums collected pursuant to section 53.\n\nBeyond the right to use McGill branding and perhaps some terms on the use of McGill facilities, the MoA is far more beneficial to the McGill administration than to SSMU as it provides very few benefits to SSMU that the law doesn't already enforce."", ""There has to be a better way to coordinating student strikes against Israel other than smashing up your own school and get your organization gutted because you turned everyone against you. I think Israel must stop their genocide in Gaza as much as the people involved in these protests, but protesting against your own school isn't going to get the kids unbombed or stop the zionists from doing it again. \n\nThere are 2 Israeli consulate offices in Montreal, why don't they protest in front of these places? What does McGill have to do with the political decisions of Israel to commit a genocide? You think the Israeli leadership is going to listen to the McGill principal to stop killing children because their students weren't happy they hold shares of Lockheed? The minuscule amount of economic pressure towards one of their suppliers won't do anything to change the actions of Israel.\n\nYes, McGill invested in Lockheed, Raytheon, etc, but so did everyone that bought an S&P 500 index fund, are we going to smash the Canada Pension Plan's office too? Are we going to riot in front of a retirement home because the people living there are using their shares of SPY and VOO to pay for their food?"", 'The strike was a strategic disaster. It was poorly executed and escalated to tactics which were explicitly outside the purview of the motion (it was supposed to be voluntary, not enforced by blockades or picketing), turned public opinion further against SPHR and Pro-Palestine policies due to aggressive tactics, and spoon-fed a talking point into the admin\'s mouth (""violence occurred and a staff member was hit"").\n\nMeanwhile, precisely zero tangible benefits were gained for Palestinians, but now it is resulting in SSMU going through a costly dispute resolution procedure and losings it MOU. I am opposed to Israel committing war crimes in Palestine, but in my view, SSMU should have campaigned against the strike motion because it was not a helpful or productive form of activism - it was actively harmful to both the student body and to the divestment cause.', ""This has the potential to be terrible for student life (Gerts, clubs & activities) including various benefits & all things finance (with the finance role already being near unmanageable for a student rep)- I think it'll depends on what this means specifically for relations. I'd worry about student representation. That being said I agree the SSMU is a mess- still McGill would do better to help bolster a student forum like this one rather than essentially beginning to dismantle it. I understand the frustration with the protest and I think much of the student body feels the same so it seems unfair to punish us and the SSMU when they clearly criticised protest that wasn't peaceful MANY times in emails etc. They're in a hard position too, they want to represent the students and would've faced immense criticism if they hadn't supported the strike."", ""Why are people celebrating? Doesn't this mean we will lose access to a bunch of student benefits like our dental plans, etc?"", ""Outside of the argument about whether SSMU is representing well/right/wrong, etc, I don't know how this works. It was my understanding that under Bill 32 (loi 32) studient unions/associations are recognized through a formal vote from students and their existence/ability to fund themselves and get money from students is not up to university administrations. As such, I don't understand what the email means. Is McGill just going to give them the bare minimum required by law and not cooperate to provide them with more/involve them in processes, etc?"", 'A bunch of undergrads are about to get a reality check when their club funding (and therefore club activities) dry up', 'So can I get a refund\xa0', 'The explanation seems logical to me. SSMU has been corrupt in many ways than this, they need a reality check.', 'Good. Compared to equivalents in other Canadian universities the SSMU has been awful for years. Maybe this will kick it into shape, or let it die so something better can replace it.', 'They did this to themselves. Absolutely deserved.', 'Huge McGill W', 'This is great news. Useless ass organization that was charging a fee every semester.\n\nAnd now there’s room for a potentially helpful student group. One that cares about assuring affordable food on campus, or pushes for an increase in the amount of Wellness Hub slots.\n\nIt seems like all the SSMU wanted to do was force (10% should not be considered enough to put something into action, maybe people would vote if you were ever actually helpful) useless protests that almost always led to vandalism or worse. Gotta love when the student union blocks access to courses, really helping with my education there. Good riddance, please have a reform if they come back.\n\nFor the first time, I actually feel like McGill is listening to its students.', '[deleted]', 'Good. The fact that a student governance body whose core mission is ensure the safety, wellness, and learning experience for its students utterly failed to prevent - and perhaps even supported - a violent protest that prevented student from attending classes and staff from going about their most basic tasks is just pathetic. Not to mention the fear and harm done to the staff whose office was assaulted by a bunch of raging teenagers. McGill needs a reset, and students need to be expelled.', 'i didn’t love the ssmu, but i hate mcgills extortion even more', 'SSMU’s relationship with both McGill’s administration and the student body has been in slow decline for years. I feel as though it was only a matter of time before this happened.', 'McGill should have absolved/ removed SSMU long time ago. Hope they do. They’ve been useless clueless and trouble in too many ways, with the members just wanting cushy paying positions during their undergrad and bringing in their friends into other positions instead of people who actually want to do things properly.', 'I totally get both people fed-up with the strike tactics as well as worried about the future of student services.\n\nBut for me this speaks volumes to the admin’s politics. They disagree with a political motion that was voted on, so they pull the plug on SSMU. It is our current political climate which allows them to feel empowered to go this far. If you-know-who wasn’t doing the same things down south, this would make national Canadian headlines and you would find democrats of good conscience up in arms against an admin’s ability to do this.', ""TL;DR\n\nMcGill is ending its current contract with the Students' Society of McGill University (SSMU), citing concerns over the SSMU's failure to clearly distance itself from groups involved in vandalism and intimidation during recent protests. The three-day strike disrupted campus life and included a violent incident where staff were harmed. While SSMU has since condemned the violence, McGill insists that peaceful protest must be shown in actions, not just words. The university will enter mediation with SSMU but is prepared to ensure student services and representation continue regardless of the outcome"", ""I mean, violently taking over buildings is going to lead to some sort of consequences you'd have to expect.... that might be the educational moment for some of those people who participated as they don't seem to be attending classes."", 'sucks to suck. ssmu asked for it.', ""Can someone tell what exactly is the difference between this form of protest and picketing? Same concept isn't it? Where is this idea born that the only acceptable peaceful protest is where everyone else can do whatever they normally do? Those Gandhi-esq protests aren't possible these days.\n\nWhen Canada Post employees were on strike did they allow others to get in and do their jobs? Could the admin go and process letters? When CRA employees strike can seniors process returns and continue business as usual? Really wild that admin is trying to paint the picture that all of these protests are violent because they blocked students and teachers. Union buster Saini living up to his reputation. The reality is admin would do everything other than divest from Israel’s apartheid regime.\xa0"", ""If anything SSMU is acting apolitically here. They didn't take a side on the strike motion, they just allowed members to vote on it. But ofc that's not enough for McGill"", 'Hopefully the CAQ removes legal requirements for student unions. This group has gone insane', 'Is there any way to block the near-daily emails from McGill Communications about the protests or SSMU without also missing important stuff?', 'It’s about time.  They have disrupted the student experience at McGill for too long.', 'The student society should be organizing dances and selling mimosas on campus, none of this other garbage! We need a complete overhaul where the student society is run by UNPAID students doing it for the interest of their peers. This is a university not the god dam United Nations. The role of the society should be to enhance and complement the university experience, not disrupt and destroy it.', 'Lmao good riddance', ""SSMU has been f'ing around for years now: defamation, discrimination, lawsuits, etc etc. Time to find out. Whatever the Quebec law for student unions was imagining, it wasn't something this stupid and dysfunctional."", 'Good, fuck the SSMU', 'Honestly i kinda get it. The protests were getting too violent. If they were actually peaceful they wouldn’t have done anything', ""🎶 Gooooooood neeeeeeeeews 🎶 \n\n✨ She's deaaaaaaaaaad ✨"", 'the SSMU has been nothing short of a radicalized violent group for the last \\~2 years\n\ntheir protests have brought nothing but violence, intimidation, and harassment to the campus.  \ntheir encampents have shit, drugs, needles\n\ntheir ""protests"" have consistenly had non mcgill members cause problems\n\nbig McGill W\n\nthe lunatics can\'t keep running the assylum forever', ""I'm so tired of hearing other McGill students blame everything that happens on protestors, rather than opening their eyes and seeing how the overpaid administration keeps failing them time and time again. McGill has this opportunity to be such a better place to learn than it is. Cutting ties with SSMU is completely illogical. SSMU called a referendum, but the entire student body had the opportunity to vote, and the vote was for the strike. Now they are going to get rid of the SSMU for doing what it is here for: to let the voices of the student body be heard. \n\nAnd for everyone jumping through hoops to defend the administration, or comparing McGill to other universities, I ask why do you think it is so necessary for a place of learning to invest in firearms and weapons. I don't care how many universities do it. It is illogical, and should not be allowed to become a norm.

I don't know what percentage of people involved in that are actually members of SPHR or closely aligned with the group's views, but, either way, it's only a minority of students who actually went out to vote for the strike in the first place."", 'it sounds like you and I agree that some measure of civil disobedience is warranted in this situation. However, you seem to be evaluating that civil disobedience purely on its effect on public opinion.\n\nFor a number of reasons, this is an unproductive and ahistorical view.  Firstly, the need for civil disobedience arises precisely because public opinion fails to effect change. Your criticism also implies that being alienating to people is the same thing as turning them against the cause. But most students are still pro-divestment even if they\'re anti-SPHR. \nThird, listening to moderates is honestly not very productive. If you are nominally sympathetic to Palestinians but your only real engagement with the issue is criticizing other people\'s tactics, then you can\'t really claim to have a good-faith investment in the effort. It\'s hard for me to see people having your takes as a serious loss for the cause, because I don\'t buy that you would\'ve shown up anyway were the tactics more sensible. Compared to committed activists, both peaceful and otherwise, you lack both the knowledge and credibility to make strategic recommendations.\n\nMessaging discipline and gaining support are important aspects of militancy, but they are not the main focus. Consider the downstream effects of a dockworkers strike, and you will see why they usually don\'t go over well with the general public. But this is the miracle of the union: by creating a persistent threat to the functions of society, they have proven to be the only way ordinary people are able to gain real concessions from power structures.\n\nIf we understand the strike as a strike, that is, focused on exacting a material toll on McGill rather than courting public favor, then it was indeed effective, substantive, and targeted. It specifically targeted McGill\'s main product, while negative externalities on students were lessened because professors are required to give accommodations. It was substantive, with a well communicated demand as well as additional educational and fundraising efforts. And they were effective in that they affected both McGill\'s value proposition and its broader reputation. Crucially, they didn\'t result in any police involvement. No harm came to students or staff (except protestors themselves being assaulted) and the actions did not constitue criminal activity. So as civil disobedience goes, it was also quite tame.  \n\nAnd none of this is meant to be popular! The objective is to pose a persistent threat to business as usual until conditions are met. And until such time, a growing number of people with no skin in the game will see their campus overrun with cops and security who are tear gassing their sweaty 5\'6 anarchist classmates and think ""damn, they\'d rather do this than divest from Lockheed Martin?""\nMcGill\'s choice to crack down on students is theirs alone and they own the consequences. Universities like John\'s Hopkins, Brown, and UniMelb saw their major protests resolved by negotiating and engaging in partial or total divestment. So if you see the students as ""the problem"" and not Slave Owner University which used to have a quota to avoid admitting too many Jews and won\'t pull out $7m in shares of assorted bomb makers, then that\'s something I can\'t help you with.\n\nIf you think these historically based tactics are still bad, then I would invite you to seriously map out another pathway which tangibly leads to change and has done so in the past, rather than appealing to respectability and moderation that is proving ineffective in real time.', ""Ending a genocide doesn't justify breaking a few windows?"", 'If McGill terminates their connection with the current SSMU \n\nWhy can’t people who still wants one make a new one which McGill will support', "">I would also not trust the university, which has a history of reallocating funds from student services to its central operating budget, with being generous with their money.\xa0\n\nNot to mention the university still hasn't paid its TAs from last year."", "">As we move forward, the University will enter the mediation process with SSMU in the spirit of resolution.

This vocal minority of committed activists have been trying to popularize divestment from Israel for literally decades, and have had no major policy victories. In fact, where divestment has happened, it has largely been as a result of “obtaining popular support” through established channels like democratic participation (see e.g. electing pro-Palestine governments in places like Ireland or Scandinavia who enact divestment policies, and those victories did not flow from civil disobedience but rather civic participation).\n\n**Israel is not South Africa** because there is increased entrenchment of support for Israel relative to there was for South Africa within the establishment, and the only thing which can possibly defeat it is a united majority of citizens rallying behind the Palestinian cause.\xa0There was far less ""cost"" for governments and institutions to divest from South Africa because the South African apartheid regime had far less influence and power, so the ""tipping point"" of where the costs of civil disobedience outweighed the cost of partnership, was far, far, FAR lower than it is for Israel. In Israel\'s case, that tipping cost point is so high that it would essentially require outright majority support of a given community in order to reach it.\n\nIn other words, “maximum disruption” style disobedience from a vocal minority, simply **will not work** with Israel. The only thing that will work is a united majority of citizens. Aggressive  or ""unappetizing"" civil disobedience in this sense only goes to harm the cause by reinforcing public perception that being pro-Palestine is a fringe or radical minority position. Winning enough public opinion support so as to force the LPC or NDP to change their stances is the way, and that does not happen through camping in public parks, attacking Professors for holding class/students for going to class, screaming at people, breaking windows, etc.\xa0\n\nYour statement boils down to, “the only people who can dictate strategics are people who have failed to achieve any tangible successes and do a bad job. If you disagree with those tactics, you’re a moderate and we don’t care about you anyways”.\xa0 Okay, you keep going with that, and when you’re ready to stop virtue signalling and step off your fabricated moral pedestal, all of the coalition partners you’re turning down will be ready to get to work.\xa0', 'hows the ""ending the genocide"" part going for you?', ""I'm not sure if that would be possible- I imagine it would be more complicated because of all the ties SSMU has to various clubs/ services (but I have no idea!)"", ""I'm not saying raising money is bad, just saying that more needs to be a done.

Literally threaten that they can no longer help the protest efforts if actions like this continue. They are at least partially responsible for classes/education being affected, they should be apologizing and taking accountability, like adults.\n\nProtesters did do the actions, but people are often blinded by morals and by group pressure while protesting, so they don’t look at their actions in a vacuum. This is true of almost any protest that has ever happened. The SSMU is supposed to be ensuring things don’t get out of hand and enforcing the code of conduct when things do get out of hand, which they failed to do.\n\nThey denounced the SPHR one time, which should’ve been the end of that group, then went right back to supporting them immediately.\n\nOther than that, why does the guise of being a protester hold so much power at McGill?

The generational shift in public opinion is one which will have real political consequences for politicians and which offers the best chance for a change of course. But why are you speaking about this as if it\'s a hypothetical? A majority of Canadians already favor an arms embargo. I come from the States. Here are a few things that a large (60%+) majority of Americans agree upon: gun control, free or reduced college tuition, socialized health care, an end to foreign wars, a decrease in the military budget, abortion rights, and guess what, an arms embargo! 34%(!!!) of 2020 Biden voters who didn\'t vote for Harris did so because of her Israel stances. \n\nWill shifting public opinion on Israel affect the political establishment? On a generational scale, probably. But in the short term it should be obvious to you that the government is distinctly undemocratic on this and other issues. Your argument that Israel is more entrenched in our politics than SA actually weakens your point because the democratic will is even more suppressed in this case than during the apartheid, thus making the case for civil disobedience stronger.\n\n(FYI: Ireland is not the case study you are looking for. They have been pro Palestine since independence because they are also a former British colony and gained their sovereignty through violent revolution. They are a principled anti-imperialist state in the same way Malaysia is.)\n\nWhat is most frustrating about your line of thinking is the false dichotomy between these approaches. you frame electoral politics/peaceful protests/fundraising and more vigorous actions as mutually exclusive, when in fact, they are being engaged simultaneously, including during the strike. the organizers for whom you have so much animosity dedicate most of their waking lives to raising awareness, making gofundmes, community building. many of them are Palestinians themselves, whose relatives are dying in real time. occasionally, these people engage in more disruptive activities. You meanwhile, have probably used the word ""Palestine"" more often in this thread than you have anywhere else put together. You speak as if virtue signalling and popularity in certain circles are the only thing that could possibly motivate someone to use such tactics. If you cannot empathize with being so moved by injustice and violence that you say ""I will do anything to stop this"" and spend time, money, and considerable risk to your identity and personal safety, that is a failure of imagination on your part which is born out of privilege. \n\nI\'m not saying everyone with tactical disagreements is a moderate that I don\'t care about. I\'m saying that you, specifically, lack knowledge and credibility. you are getting fundamental facts about the strike, civil disobedience, and the history of movements wrong in a way which betrays complete personal inexperience and illiteracy on activism.

How do you think one achieves this?\n\nSee their [famous boycott](https://forward.com/opinion/578098/bds-boycott-standing-together-occupation/) of the leftist Israeli organization Standing Together, which mobilizes Israeli jews and arabs to join forces against the far right.

McGill does need to collect and distribute the fund to SSMU based on what the members elect to pay, and the SSMU is guaranteed space with furniture and a meeting room for its Board per Quebec law. Furthermore, as I understand it, McGill cannot directly charge students for those things and must go through the accredited student union (SSMU) to get approval for those fees. It’s why SSMU has been blocking an increase to the athletic fee for years to put pressure on divestment.', 'A convenient statistic you left out is that polls have consistently found that 80% aren\'t willing to support the protest tactics of groups like SPHR, with 50% outright opposing them and saying they hold a negative view.\n\nThe disconnect between ""policy"" and ""people"" is the problem. Divestment is politically popular, but all of the associated baggage SPHR tries to import in with it is not (""all Zionists are terrorists, October 7 should be celebrated as a form of Palestinian Honour and Resistance, Israel needs to be completely destroyed since it is a colonial state"", etc), resulting in the strength of democratic willpower being reduced (""I support policy X, but the people affiliated with it seem pretty crazy and aggressive, so I will only quietly support policy X""). The actions of SPHR cuts off any potential for mass solidarity, because the only people stepping forward are SPHR, precisely because SPHR writes everyone off who ***isn\'t*** SPHR as pro-genocide.\n\nI don\'t agree with the choices made by the leadership of SPHR, and I also disagree with your characterization that they engage in only ""occasional disruption"". months-long encampments, blockades, storming buildings, breaking things, screaming, vandalism, etc, are more than ""occasional disruption"". We wish for many of the same policy outcomes, but I simply don\'t believe in those forms of civil disobedience as an effective means to an end. I will advocate for Palestinian human rights elsewhere, in ways that I will not disclose to you nor do I need to.\n\nI will say, though, that it is precisely because I care about Palestinian human rights that I will not sit idly by as I witness a small vocal group of individuals actively reduce community support and solidarity for divestment while completely ignoring all criticism, even from people who oppose Israel\'s war crimes and human rights abuses.\n\nTo use your language, it\'s just my opinion that that kind of behaviour reflects a sense of grandeur and self-importance which is not only a little bit delusional, but also which demonstrates ""a lack of focus on the genocidal topic at hand"".', '… you act like Kamala is much worse than trump regarding Palestine \n\nHow in the world would voting against Kamala have helped Palestinians? \n\nThe trump government is literally deporting Palestine supporters.', 'Illiteracy rates are pretty low at McGill, you sure you’re a student?', 'Personally, I support divesting from weapons manufacturers that sell arms to governments who commit war crimes (Israel, but also many other states as well). \n\nI also support some degree of sanctions and punishment for Israel for not doing a good enough job to minimize child casualties (that’s not to say I want to destroy Israel or think it shouldn’t exist). \n\nI also try to avoid buying from companies like Sabra that operate factories in areas of the West Bank that are illegally occupied by Israel according to the UN. \n\nSo, one could say I support some iteration of “BDS”.

I can't help but feel like I'm back in January 2021, with the same bullshit curfew and the same bullshit restrictions put in place without any meaningful research done as to whether they have any effect whatsoever. 

I'm honestly starting to ask myself.... Why the hell do I have to spend a decent chunk of my twenties bending over backwards to protect people who don't want to be protected and refuse to even get vaccinated? 

This fucking pandemic ruined the friendships I was building before it hit (and my social 'circle' has now atrophied to my siblings, who are already my roommates). 

This fucking pandemic ruined my chance to go on exchange to a *really* dope university in Germany 

This fucking pandemic ruined my chance to date while in university

This fucking pandemic nearly destroyed my mental health

This fucking pandemic robbed me of a chance to experience McGill's student life to its fullest, and now student clubs have been utterly gutted by the pandemic

I clawed myself out of the mental health dumpster fire that was 2021, while doing literally everything I could to protect people from COVID. I vaccinated myself the moment I could (I showed up to Palais de Congres at 5AM waiting in line for it) I washed my hands, I wore my mask everywhere, I didn't gather with friends, I sanitized my hands when entering or leaving grocery stores, I got my second shot as soon as possible, etc. etc. etc. 

I convinced myself that all that effort would be worth it, because by 2022 it'd all be over. Or at least *better.* I fooled myself into thinking that nobody would agree to such a dumbfuck ill-advised scientifically unsupported curfew again, and here we are.

Why in God's green **fuck** why does January 2022 feel **exactly** like January 2021? In spite of all this work that I'm doing to protect these ungrateful unvaccinated soon-to-be-hospitalized twits, I'm still stuck inside and can't even go on a goddamn walk in the evening. 

I can't even complain about this curfew or protest about being denied a fundamental right to movement, because then I'd get lumped in with all the antivaxx wackadoodles. It's so goddamn frustrating.

1638741750.0,It's a Monday.,"It's a Monday.

Your alarm goes off at 7:30. You skeletally extend an arm to snooze the phone. You pull back your arm. After a few more cycles, you leave the warmth of your bed at 7:50. You go drink a glass of cold water. You take a shower. You pour yourself a cup of coffee and put two slices of bread in the toaster while your hair is drying. You quietly eat your breakfast. When you're finished, you put your dishes away in the sink. You start work at 8:30. You'll take care of that later.

8:30. You sit at your home desk and start your computer. You input your credentials. You open Outlook and Teams. You have six new emails, three of which are actionable items for you. You are a little busy, but not *too* busy. You have a great work life balance. Your boss is flexible and understands that life is not all about work. You knock two items off your todo list by noon. You step away from the computer. You go in the kitchen and eat your pre-prepared lunch, along with snacks. Maybe a cup of greek yogurt and a smoothie to give you a boost of energy for the afternoon.

13:00 You go back to work. You input your credentials again. You received three new emails while you were away, two of which you were cc'ed in and don't need to act upon. You hop on your daily meeting with your coworkers. ""Hi anon. How are you today?"" says your boss. ""I'm great, thanks. What about you?"", you reply. Your coworkers and you exchange a few jokes and make small talk before getting down to business. The meeting lasts 30 minutes. You reply to an email. You do your work. There is no rush. The deadlines are weeks away and you're already 75% finished. 

17:00. Your workday is over. You send a quick email to your colleague to let him know where things stand on your side. You turn off your computer and get up your chair. You eat a snack. You grab your phone and go lay down on the couch. You get up to date with your social feeds. Check your brother's new IG story. Hey, your friend has a sassy new TikTok clip. Your uncle and aunt will be in town next week and would like to go see a movie with you. ""Sure. How about the new Spider Man. No Way Home. U down?"". ""That's a great idea, anon. Let me know what time is best for you. I'll get the tickets."" You quickly reply. You go on Reddit.com, the McGill subreddit. You read threads about exams, about the least difficult classes to pass the program, about which teacher is the worst, about SSMU, about REAL TALK. One of the comments makes you chuckle. You put down your phone. It's now 18:00. You turn on your gaming PC and play a few rounds of your favorite game. You make yourself dinner, or you order through UberEats. Your evening is free. You have nothing *to* do. You have all the time to yourself. You graduated two years ago. You still have your old textbooks in a closet. You're thinking about selling some of them. Others, maybe you'll revisit them, because you genuinely find them interesting. You just hate homework, tests, and classes.

20:00 You take a shower and change in your pajamas. You play a few more rounds of your favorite game. Damn, it's really fun. You were the top player in 3/5 rounds.

21:30 You grab a novel and get into bed. You're at chapter 24. It's really interesting.

22:30 Time to go to bed soon. You check your phone one more time. You open your brokerage app. Your investments have made +13% in the last month. Thanks to the steady paychecks from your job, you can afford to save for the future, to buy yourself a new car, and eventually a small piece of land or a condo not too far from work. Life is good.

You set your alarm for tomorrow. Check your feeds one last time. Instagram. TikTok. Some dumb argument in one of your friends' Facebook feeds.

You put down your phone and turn off the lights. You sleep soundly knowing that for all your past suffering, for all you have endured, you no longer have to care about classes, coursework, readings (oh, you read more than ever, but your future doesn't depend on your ability to recall the minutiae of it), tests, papers, homework. All of that is behind you.

You see, the 100 person orgy I hold every year was supposed to happen tomorrow. However, I needed a new shower slip mat to make sure everyone could wash up real good -- safely -- after getting down and filthy. Imagine my shock when I got to the bath section of my local dollarama to find that the slip mats were roped off! Without this, my orgy could not possibly proceed, and I had to call all the members of my polycule (and the extended polycule, god margaery is IMPOSSIBLE to talk to these days after she got that new job at TotallyNotEnablingEthnicCleansing.AI) and cancel.

I have to say, I'm really proud of Legault for predicting this situation and acting proactively to act against it. He personally stopped what would have been an 100 person outbreak simply by banning the sale of bath accessories.

1646612957.0,The reopening of Gerts was an abject failure and we're only OK with it because practically nobody knows how cheap it used to be.,"For those of you who don't already know, Gerts is our student bar which somehow manages to charge similar prices to practically every bar in St. Laurent. 

We've got to ask ourselves how the fuck that's humanly possible. [In 2015 pitchers of beer at Gerts were $10 on Fridays.](https://eus.wiki/Gertrude%27s_Theorem) Let's do the simple math. According to inflation, that should mean that the special for pitchers of beer should cost $11.69, which rounded up should be $12 maximum. So why is the 'friday special' nowadays $15? That's $3 extra dollars, and when you buy more than one pitcher it adds up really fast. Plus, pitchers at Thompson House (that's the bar for masters students) costs $15.75 at any time of the week in the status quo, **[while also having a restaurant with cheap eats attached](http://thomsonhouse.ca/menus/8/Restaurant).** So Thompson house can have a restaurant and a bar with pitchers that are literally cheaper than Gerts right now... But for some reason we're supposed to shell out $17 a pitcher at Gerts, a bar-only institution with way more potential turnover? 

It's fucking grift, I tell you. SSMU is running our student bar as if it is a for-profit organization, when it really should be at best, breaking even. In fact, a good chunk of SSMU funding should be used to subsidize our student bar so that we can actually have a student life that thrives instead of withering on the vine. 

I shouldn't leave Gerts wishing I brought flasks like I'm living in Chicago during the goddamn Prohibition just so I can get tipsy without blowing a hole through my wallet. 

**Second to last point:** When SSMU makes Gerts no less expensive than any other bar on St. Laurent, students are forced to go to bars that are fundamentally not as safe as a student-run bar. As /u/Thermidorien said, part of the reason it's great to have heavily subsidized bars is because it gives students a SAFE place to hang out and take the edge off. Younger students might even get drunk for the first time in a student bar, and it would be a lot safer for them to get drunk there than at some skeevy cheap dive bar on St. Laurent filled with creepy 40 and 50 year olds. 

**Final point, accessibility:** When SSMU claims that student life should be accessible to all but makes going out with friends incredibly fucking expensive, it makes it much harder for people who don't have an enormous budget to participate in student life. 

SSMU should subsidize things people *actually* give a damn about. A good chunk of SSMU's *job* should be about figuring out a way for us to get as turnt as possible, as cheap as possible. Right now, they're not doing that. At all.

**Quick Update**: 

Right now I'm actually talking to the VP internal, who has seen the post and is also concerned about the prices (of course, I'm not being salty about Gerts over Outlook like I was in this post, that'd be really rude). 

It really seems like the VP internal is concerned and trying her best to work out a way to make the bar more accessible to as many students as possible. It seems like a great step in the right direction! :)","['/u/The_McGill_Tribune Will be a nice topic to cover.', 'A M E N\n\nAs someone who is finishing his 7th year at McGill, the new Gerts is a travesty and a shadow of the old one.

Paying people $30,000 a year EACH with 5 executives BEING PAID  is an absolute grift considering NOTHING gets done.\n\nSSMU might be the most inefficient method of what it ought to be, it should be a database where clubs apply for funding and said funding is distributed and space is made in the student building for them to have meetings etc.', 'so surprising coming from the ssmu', '/u/Razwog for SSMU President.', 'Didn’t they just go through major renovations? Improvements cost money which may account for the price increases being higher than inflation. I agree it’s a shame though, student bars should theoretically be the cheapest option.', 'I would generally disagree with you if it weren’t the case that student fees continue to rise and if legal fees weren’t as exorbitant (as others ITT have mentioned).\n\nShort of irresponsible financial management, though, totally disagree that SSMU should aim to make Gerts a break even department. The whole logic of profit-seeking activities in a non-profit is the offsetting of inherently deficit-running departments, such as the government and university-facing advocacy, staffing for insurance packages and bank accounts, building management, etc. that are offered by SSMU. In a well-run year, Gerts and other income should mean a decrease in student fees (or at the very least, not the constant increase we see year over year). \n\nSure, don’t make it exorbitantly expensive, but 2$ shots aren’t exactly harm reductive. And that money could go toward better things than alcohol subsidies alone.', ""I'm sure this will get downvoted to hell, but let's remember how hard it still is to hire good staff in the service industry right now, and how much wages need to increase to make that happen so that places can open at all.

As a someone who lives in Montreal, if McGill were to open in the fall, we would risk transmission within our own community and within the **entire** downtown core of the city, including all the major transport areas and where most of the city's homeless population lives and sleeps.

It is normal to be super disappointed about losing certain university experiences and having classes done remotely, but as an entire community, we are potentially saving *lives. LOTS of lives.* How much more concrete ""positive social action"" could we get? If taking a class online could potentially spare someone from going to the ER room or losing a loved one, I am kinda all in.

We have no actually idea what the risk of transmission is or would be if we had people come back to campus. We have ideas and theories - but realistically, I don't think we actually know. Can you imagine what would happen if we *did* go on campus and a bunch of people got sick, or even potentially died? How would McGill look then?

In McGill’s case, the fact that approximately 50 percent of our students are from outside Quebec makes this a particularly high risk. Consequently, the provisional budget prepared includes several expenditure control measures to mitigate the impact of enrolment-driven revenue losses. These measures include:\n\n* Suspension of tenure-track and contract academic hiring until further notice (with the exception of course lecturers where necessary to ensure program continuity)\n* Suspension of administrative and support staff hiring until further notice\n* Salary freeze for all senior administrators and Deans\n* Six-month deferral of merit-based salary increases for all non-unionized academic and administrative support staff\n* Deferring planned expenditures across all sectors of the University\n* Additional non-salary expenditure reductions of approximately 3%\n* Restricting new expenditure allocations to mission-critical activities (including those that may be necessary to adjust to post-COVID 19 conditions), core operations, and contractual obligations.\n\nBecause capital projects are not funded from the operating revenue of the University, critical capital infrastructure projects will continue.""', 'Satire is for commies.', 'https://youtu.be/j2zlPNGuPbw', ""Look at some of the states in the US, they're already almost fully operational. Canada will follow soon, especially by September or else a lot of places will shut down."", 'Their point is that if they are simply doing this for COVID 19 measures, mcgill should acknowledge and reduce tuition costs, which I agree as I am an international student first hand experiencing this.', 'Here’s their 2019 audit: https://www.mcgill.ca/vpadmin/files/vpadmin/audited_financial_statements_year_ended_april_2019_0.pdf\n\nAnd here’s their budget book: https://www.mcgill.ca/budget/files/budget/160923_budget_book_short_form_text_-_landscape_-_final.pdf\n\nMcGill currently spend 35M$/year on library services and another 28M$/year on institutions services. There are plenty of places where operational costs can be reduced while still enabling maintenance for continuation. You are right about tuition revenue representing a large portion. In fact, it’s 350M out of 1.4Bn.\n\nI appreciate you understanding that this is a free market and that I can go to coursera. Unfortunately, my ancestor’s 50% marginal tax rate has already invested in McGill and the reason for doing so is the product offered by McGill provides superior education to tolls like coursera. However when you remove physical office hours, have profs who can’t figure out how to do online saying they’re too shy to speak in a virtual lecture, remove access to labs, libraries and services then the educational product loses much of its value.\n\nI’m not saying that moving to virtual is a bad move. I absolutely agree that it must be done to preserve healthcare, but I am stating that McGill may have ulterior motives based on their current financial data and if they’re really doing so for the sake of society they would take measures on tuition to reflect so.', ""I really like reading these responses analyzing the issue of tuition reduction. On the other end, as a course instructor but also in student services while a PhD candidate, I've received multiple cuts in contracts and I'm not sure how many more cuts will be done (at least in my faculty as well as the departments that I work in) that pretty much reduces availability of university jobs where they are also students. It's complex I find... And like someone else suggested, being transparent would be the best approach since simply reducing tuition can have large ramifications to student jobs."", 'As an graduate of McGill - my tuition feels worth it because of my on campus experience and the resources I had access to (including people and places). I don’t think McGill can offer the same level of education online, and students can’t receive it as efficiently online.

Or the constant ""new initiatives"" they fund and pump out every year to seem productive. Like the ""ingenuity think tank"" they just started that\'s hiring interns. Wtf is that? Half of these initiatives aren\'t even sustainable and are just trophies.', 'Ok but no need to call it a ploy as if the sole motivation for this is to exploit intl students for money.', 'Yeah and they also have over billion dollars in debt. Unfortunately it\'s a lot more complicated than just looking at total revenue or cost. You don\'t know what things cost, or you\'re at least completely ignoring it. You can only speculate about what cuts would amount to. \n\nMcGill is already making budget cuts. Prices are determined by the market, and McGill isn\'t going to lower them because they\'re not a charity. McGill is doing its best to provide the best education it can provide to its students and to make the accomodations they can in this kind of situation. \n\nAlso tuition isn\'t the only revenue source being affected, when enrollment lowers they get less grant money from the government. That\'s why they quoted 80% and not 25%. They\'re also losing money from not being able to sell goods and services, there\'s no foreign exchange, etc. \n\nAlso you\'re creating a false dichotomy by talking about ""what they\'re doing it for"". There\'s more than one reason at play. They don\'t have to either altruistic or completely self-interested.', 'Yes, but tuition isn\'t valued according to your subject notion of its value - it is all based on operations costs, staffing, maintenance, equipment, building costs, administrative needs, software costs. It is fine to say ""I think I should pay less because I don\'t think it will be as good"" but that is significantly different from actually knowing the costs behind providing you an education, whether remote or not.\n\nIt just seems like an argument based on emotion rather than logic or fact (and as a side-note, I want to validate the emotions around feeling this way because I think it is to be expected and a normal reaction, especially if there is a lot of financial difficulty being experienced).\n\nLike lots of people have said, the costs during a pandemic are greater, not smaller. It just doesn\'t make sense to cut yourself at the knees (by reducing tuition) when you are already on the verge of drowning due to revenue decreases. Just putting on my business management hat here, but you get my point?\n\nAnd again, I think there is a general failure to understand the bottom line. Cutting tuition means cutting services and staff: the first jobs to go are going to be student jobs. And then people will complain there are no work opportunities (TA\'s, Invigilators, RA\'s, research) and that services, when they do resume, aren\'t high quality or comprehensive. There is no winning.', ""70% of the fees I pay are for services are things I never EVER use to be honest. And they haven't exactly said that nothing would be provided either. As far as we know, there might be some things that are, just delivered differently, or online programs that would be developed for training, workouts, yoga, who knows."", 'Those are good points.\n\nAt the end of the day, if I’m dining at a 5 star restaurant, I expect my 75$ filet mignon to come with sauce and a salad on the side. If those aren’t included due to the company suffering debts and the employees getting underpaid, that 75$ meal does not hold the same value.\n\nAlso announcing it this early on gives me a weird feeling about this specially considering the number of active cases has stabilized now.', 'I totally see your side of this, but I’m saying I couldn’t afford to pay what I did for McGill if I got a lower quality of education. You’re right, there is no winning. \n\nI’m not saying that they can operate differently, but that I represent an unknown portion of students who would not attend as online students.', 'Fair!']",380

1556322565.0,My unsent letter to fellow McGillians,"So I am graduating — 4 years, I guess last week, last exam, this is it. Since I am no valedictorian, I figure this is a place that is as good as any to say some of my thoughts that I have never had the chance to say out loud.

**To my professors,**

Gosh, some of you sucked. Some of you only cared about your research, so you show up with download-from-internet-5-min-ago slides, and don’t even know what is on your own assignments. Some of you mocked undergrads like us, think we are stupid, and I clearly recall one of you hinting that I am simply not “cut-out” for this subject; and quite frankly, it's at those moments— I felt like giving up.

However, during every such moment, there always seems to one of you that handed me the help and the hope I needed. I remember being embarrassed having tears dripping down on my paper as I couldn’t understand your lectures. So you pretend you didn’t see it while continue to explain the concept for the 4th time. You also made sure to tell me I was doing a good job simply by trying before I leave. Another one of you taught me how to spot and forgive my own mistakes, both as a scientist and as a person.  You gave me guidance on career and on life. You were composed and wise. As a person who is hot-tempered and emotional, a good number of you taught me how to distance myself, think clearly and objectively. Some of your words are the same words that I will ponder upon perhaps for a better half of my lifetime.

**To My Fellow Classmen**

You are without a doubt some of the most daring and ambitious people I have ever seen. Don’t get me wrong, some of you are indeed arrogate, with an inflated sense of grandiose, and quite frankly not a nice person. But among you, I have also seen courage like I have never seen before. You influenced me to dream for a higher height, to be relentless, to have perseverance when it seems like that the pressure is too high, and the chances are too small. I came to McGill expecting a stepping stone to secure jobs/ a “normal life”, I go home disappointed. Little by little, you show me that despite its complicated existence, the world indeed has a place for dreams and passions, and for those who truly cares about thinking. I walk away holding those thoughts, your thoughts, about truth and life dear to my heart, and I hope to God, that I don’t forget them along my way.

**To my physics, computer science, stats, linear algebra TAs**

You don’t get paid enough for you do, thank you. You are nothing like some of the arrogant douchy guys I would meet in class. You are patient, kind, (funny in some cases :p) and cared about teaching me the tools to think. Unlike some people including some of my classmates, you didn't treat me as a girl in hard sciences, you treated me as just a scientist/researcher (even though I am yet far from it). We discuss theorems and corollaries for hours without realizing the time, until the security kick us out of the classroom. You respond to emails at midnights, make an effort to make time for me during your lunch hours. You taught me more than the professors ever did. I remember each one of your names, and I am so glad that some of us have become friends. And I am so happy that things are working out well for you guys, some of you have new jobs, got married, some are going to post-doc at amazing places, you have my deepest respect and I wish you all the best.

**To my best friends who happens to not understand a single thing about what I do:**

As fate would have it, we do not study the same thing, or even in the same faculty, and its miraculous that we met. However none of this stops you from being my biggest support(s). You keep me sane when I am lost in the competition, or rat race or whatever it is that you call it. You keep me focused on the bigger picture — well, we keep each other(s) focused on the bigger picture. You are forgiving of my mistakes, of my egos, while being honest. You are direct, yet gentle. You told me that if one day I had lost everything, I can always run to you. I thank you for the generosity that is your company, here is to many years to come!

**For future incoming first year McGillians:**

Before you enter the gates, whether you are feeling confused, excited, or anxious, it is all okay. Take a deep breath, and keep count, because it’s going to go by all too fast.

I want you to know that you DO NOT need to answer to anyone but yourself. Your job is to simply improve yourself in the ways that you seem fit (provided that you are a decent person). Never mind what other people think, and what other people say. People WILL laugh and mock at the clumsy way you make efforts, and the way you struggle, but don’t mind them. We mustn’t equate struggling to failing. We are learning, filling in our ignorances, exercising our weakness; which means that we are meant to be struggling. I am not going to lie, McGill is going to be hard, really really hard, and McGill as an institution does not make it any easier for you (with its mental health policies and over 600+ students classes etc.). But when it gets hard(and it will), you’re falling down again and again, don’t beat yourself up, face it, wear it like a badge of honour. Give yourself a break if you want to, but remember that struggling is far from failing; and I would even say that if you didn’t struggle, that might be the biggest failure of all.

There is good news however, you are not alone in this. You will also meet amazing people. Whenever you see fit, learn from them, and let them change your life. With a little bit of luck, your time at McGill won’t be the best years of your life, because you will have grown and learned so much at this place that will benefit you in the future, that your best years would have yet to come.

All the best,

S.C.

A big chunk of Québec's population lived in a time where it was normal to be forced to speak english if you worked in certain stores, where the french speaking working class was incredibly mistreated by unilingual english speaking bosses, where you would not have the same opportunities as the english speaking people simply for speaking french, etc. \n\nNow these times have passed and the situation today is far better than it was and that is only because of specific interventions from the governments. Bill 101 might be the best example, because it assured that immigrants and especially children of immigrants will be perfectly intergrated to Québec's society and culture. \n\nThe difference between the protection of french in Québec and the replacement theory is that the protection of french actually has solid grounds and good arguments while the replacement theory is a xenophobic reaction that some very conservative people have. They do not have any good argument, never did the immigrants try to replace the local population in an evil plan. Also, the protection of french and the culture doesn't imply a fear of a replacement, but rather a natural erosion caused by the fact that there are only about 9 millions french speaking people in an ocean of 400 millions of english speaking people.

I’m a TA for a course of 300+ students and as if manually marking 300+ coding assignments and 300+ quiz submissions where students have hundreds of different variations for a simple program isn’t enough, I need to read through and reply to 50+ emails and discussion board complaints each day from angry students who want marks back for a question they clearly did wrong. I'm perfectly happy to explain to a student what they got wrong on an assignment or quiz and equally happy to give back marks if they deserve it, but most students contact the TAs simply to vent and release their frustrations. I've already lost count of how many disrespectful and aggressive emails I've gotten, and it really hurts. Us TAs are only trying to do our jobs. They seem to think that we TAs have the power to decide the grading scheme, when really all we do is mark their assignments and quizzes according to the guidelines set out by the professor.

They don’t seem to understand that we are also students and we’re also going through the same remote learning and life struggles that they have. I’ve already been working overtime at this position and have been neglecting my own coursework and research for this job, and I’m really overwhelmed.

I'd like to share a project a few friends and I have been working on for the past few months - [mcgill.courses](https://mcgill.courses/about). Our project aim to help the course selection process of students, and avoid the process of jumping around RateMyProfessor trying to find relevant reviews when choosing courses and instructors, or switching between eCalendar and VSB endlessly.

We created a platform where students can

* View course descriptions schedules
* Rate and review courses
* Subscribe to new reviews on courses
* Check out how instructors are rated across different courses they taught
* A course dependency graph for each course to see what pre-requisites the course needs, and what they lead to.

The website is completely free and open-sourced. We do not charge for any of the services, nor do we plan on doing so. The website does not store your personal information, and uses authenticates Microsoft OAuth with your [mail.mcgill.ca](http://mail.mcgill.ca) email to avoid review spamming. If you would like to view the source codes or report any bugs, check out our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/terror/mcgill.courses) and our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/chCXAjdn).

The first batch of the reviews were scraped from RateMyProfessor so it doesn't look too empty, and all future reviews will be natively from [mcgill.courses](https://mcgill.courses). :)

Huge credit to [UW Flow](https://uwflow.com/) from University of Waterloo, where we got this idea from.

We hope that this platform is helpful to your course selections for all future semesters to come!

1608050131.0,Ashamed,"Anyone else feel ashamed that McGill literally has so many sexual assault and rape cases imposed on its faculty/students who are allowed to roam freely with almost no punishment at all? I cant begin to imagine how unsafe the campus has become. I can literally never walk the streets near campus the same. It hurts just to read victims’ accounts. I cannot imagine the pain of living through it.

To any victim of sexual assault or harassment, I hope you heal and I hope that life brings you so much happiness that you forget all the pain you have endured. It’s not fair. You deserve so much more. I wish McGill did more. I pray McGill does more. Nobody deserves to feel unsafe in their own university.","[""I think part of the problem is the way that we portray these situations and their perpetrators. These aren't dudes in trench-coats roaming campus searching for victims, they're mutual friends  who on the surface seem just like everyone else and blend in at parties. They're opportunists. Nobody suspects *their* friend or *their* neighbour to be the one conducting themselves like this, but at the end of the day the only people who get away with this kind of behaviour are those who have a lot of friends and are well-liked. Nobody suspects that the dude who makes rape jokes is actually a rapist. That persona is part of what protects them because it makes it less likely that their victims will feel comfortable coming forward and less likely that the victims will be taken seriously.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the front of the school, they probably think that making everyone do rez project and the consent work-shop covers their ass from a legal perspective so that front there is less incentive to intervene. With respect to the most recent series of events in new rez, that student had already been evicted from rez for unrelated reasons by the time people came forward with their stories, so there is even less incentive for the school to take  action given that he has already been removed from campus. Furthermore, on paper, all of these people were breaking the residence's covid rules by inviting other students into their rooms, so the school has a plethora of guidelines/rules that they could argue that if followed would have prevented these situations from occurring. Obviously this doesn't excuse the fact that they allowed a predator to roam new rez for six months unchecked, I'm just theorizing what their defence would be from a legal perspective. Their point of view is probably that they are no longer putting students in harm's way since he was removed from campus, and that it is up to the victims to take legal action and not the school. That is the point of view that has been taken by other Canadian universities in the recent past at least."", '... So I wasn’t sure if I should, but I’ll share my story anyway— I was assaulted my first semester in rez, and  though a couple of people I told pushed me to report, I didn’t until two years later, when I found out that one of my attackers was in a leadership position in DriveSafe and I felt obligated to disclose (yes, I know, you can’t make this shit up). And... I won my case, despite the amount of time that had gone by, and I can honestly say that I was treated with the utmost respect and sympathy, and I was believed. I’m not sharing this to try to discredit ANY survivor who McGill let down, but I also don’t want someone who’s considering disclosing to feel like it’s hopeless and that justice won’t be served, either :/ However, I do have to say that this was through SSMU and not McGill admin, which I can’t speak for personally. \n\nIf any of That Guy’s victims are reading on here, or any other survivors for that matter, please know that you’re not alone— sadly rape and sexual assault aren’t uncommon, especially on college campuses. I noticed OP and a couple other commenters mentioning ‘the streets’ or ‘campus’ not feeling safe, and I feel the need to share that over 80% of survivors according to RAINN knew their attacker beforehand— mine were acquaintances— and that stranger rape is statistically very rare. Please don’t feel like you need to break out the pepper spray.\n\nETA: I’ve read the stories from the survivors and signed the petition, and I just wanted to come back and say that this has been pretty triggering for me/bringing back memories from the past, and I can only imagine I’m not the only one right now.

1729529869.0,What McGill is doing with the library is embarrassing,"I get that a lot of people don't access or need physical books anymore, and I get that there is a profound need for more study space on campus, but the idea of a university removing basically all of the books from their library more or less permanently makes my skin crawl. It's the most obvious example of the ongoing dismantlement of higher education I've ever seen.

* Moving books offsite and only storing a small percent made up of recently requested books means that the vast, VAST majority of the books in the library are going to sit in the offsite robotic storage and rot, never to be requested again. A lot of these books are also not digitized, so by sequestering them offsite, they're basically gone forever now. You can't look for or request something you don't know about, and you can't discover them on the shelves anymore; I've personally found a lot of hidden gems by going to the library to look for a specific book, then browsing the section of shelving that book is located in.
* If I'm writing a paper or manuscript, or working on something, and I realize I need to follow up on a reference in a paper I'm planning on citing, or otherwise need a book that I can't find online, I can't just wander over to the library and get it anymore. I now have to go request it, and wait for at least a full day to get it. In that time, the thing I'm working on is effectively put on pause. This is now a reality *every time I need a book from the library*.
* The current request system is not integrated well on the library website. If you want the physical version of something the library has eBook access to, you can't just search for the book, open up its info page, and request it there, you have to back out to the search results, go to the bottom, and hit a tiny 'details' link at the bottom, which will take you to the specific page you need to actually request the physical copy from robotic storage. It's unintuitive, and not signposted anywhere. It's like the library is actively trying to keep you from accessing physical copies of the books at this point.
* This also strikes me as indicative of how little McGill actually cares about learning and research; instead of finding an actually reasonable solution to the lack of space on campus, the university just looks for something to effectively destroy and replace, and the long-term consequences be damned. Again, I know most undergrads don't access and use actual books, but grad students and profs do, and a lot of us feel like we're getting screwed here just because the university doesn't actually care about either us or undergrads enough to actually figure out a sustainable long term solution to the study space issue on campus.

And now because of the provincial budget changes/cuts, the Fiat Lux project is now on hold? What does that mean? Do we now get neither a library full of books nor a renovated study space (ie. not a library)? McGill is so proud of itself, too. Look! We have the [same robotic storage system used by the FBI](https://reporter.mcgill.ca/mcgill-university-collections-centre-opens-a-new-era-for-quebec-libraries/?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=wn_Oct3_ENGLISH&utm_source=whatsnewstaff&utm_term=McGill-University-Collections-Centre-opens-a-new-era-for-Que)! How cool!

If this is what the 'new era for libraries' looks like, I want no part of it. It's the death of accessible knowledge.

Thank you for attending my overly dramatic TED talk.","['I also hate that we’re not going to have personal access to most of McGill’s physical books, but you should know that on the McGill library website there’s a ‘browse the shelf’ function where near the bottom of the page of a specific book listing it’ll have a scrollable list of books that would be shelved beside it. It even includes books that they only have digitally and so could not be on the physical shelf, but shows them where they would be shelved if they were physical. So if you have on book you’re looking for, the McGill library website will show you what would be shelved beside it.', '>indicative of how little McGill actually cares about learning and research\n\nCongrats, you solved the puzzle. I hope you figured it out sooner than me.', 'History PhD alum here; I visited the McLennan Library last summer and was shocked beyond words by what was going on. Truly godawful.', '[deleted]', 'Library worker at a different University here-\n\nThere’s currently a massive shift in libraries towards providing spaces and services which often comes at the expense of ready access to physical books, and this is for quite a few reasons. \n\nNote that this does not mean books are being left to rot when moved offsite or to an Automatic Retrieval Collection - they’re actually usually kept in a better environment for preservation than if they were on a library shelf. The majority of books at my institution haven’t been checked out once in the past eight years, so it doesn’t make sense to keep those available for browsing when they can be moved offsite and still be available if a scholar needs them. That space could be better utilized for study rooms (in extremely high demand) or expanding space for a bank of 3D Printers. \n\nThen there’s also the advent of online resources. It makes no sense for a library to keep five versions of an outdated textbook when they have an agreement with a publisher for an online version of a textbook. This is a massive space sink and is probably where the McGill library is doing some downsizing, and rightfully so. Most of the academic libraries I’ve seen are emphasizing a browsing collection of popular books and are ‘outsourcing’ academic articles and textbooks to the online publishers. \n\nThis is not the death of academia. This is libraries adapting to the 21st century to provide services modern students find useful while minimizing the amount of maintenance they have to do. You mentioned having to click an extra box to request a physical book- a real person has to go to the shelf, find that book, ship it back to the main library, and then ship it back and reshelve it when you’re done with it. Of course they want you to use the online version instead. \n\nI’d recommend everyone look into how to effectively use the library’s catalog and access digital resources, along with ILL. This post comes across as petulant and conservative as someone who is both a grad student and an academic library worker. I’d almost think it was satire if it weren’t for how much effort you put into it.', ""Most universities just expand their buildings to incorporate more study space.

I remembered when I met the Dean of Libraries a few years ago, telling her to remove all the books in the library ruins the whole ""browsing in the library books"" experience forever.

I wonder how the library space will look in the near future.\n\nAlso, about book rentals... with your McGill ID card, you can request and scan other library books at other universities instead of requesting the one at McGill of ever you need it ASAP. Some of the library books from Concordia, UdeM, and UQAM saved me during my Undergrad.', ""This sums up my feelings pretty well. I'm currently annoying the hell out of the librarians requesting a bunch of stuff from robotic shelving that honestly I just want to flip through the table of contents and/or the section at hand at for 5 seconds to see if it's what I even need.\xa0\xa0\n\n\nAnd my take might be kind of unusual, because I'm a grad student looking for information on STEM topics, specifically certain types of data analysis. You'd think an online resource would be good enough? Not even close.\n\n\n\xa01) I can't learn math-related topics on a screen or through an ebook. I have tried, it's too hard and I forget everything a few minutes later. I need to have like two sections marked at the same time to flip between, I can't scroll for that but I CAN use my fingers. I get eye strain from extended screen use and I'm ALREADY spending all my time at the computer actually doing the analysis and writing.\xa0 The idea someone learns better from a textbook than an ebook isn't that crazy (eg: https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9817.12269).\xa0\n\n\n\xa02) There aren't many journals that publish papers that actually break down the topic. I'm not going to be CITING much of that I get out but if I need to pick between analysis a and analysis b, recent papers don't actually tell me why I should pick one or the other, or explain longstanding assumptions in the field. They just cite another paper and move on. I could go down the rabbit hole or I could go to a shelf with books that have glossaries and straightforward explanations. And then flip through the related books until I spot a diagram that looks like what I'm looking for and skim a few paragraphs to see if the writing style is garbage. I looked at between 5-12 related textbooks at Schulich today and picked one from the 70s that isn't digitized because it actually explained the topic without jargon and wasn't geared for a specific computer program I'm not using. And most of the math / algorithms / analysis used in my field hasn't actually changed in 50 years, it's just been rocketpowered by increased computing power and streamlined by packages in easy to use programming languages.\xa0\n\n\n\xa0I need to do this sort of thing a lot because recent papers also use VERY UNCLEAR definitions for vocabulary and then I get into extended discussions with my advisor, lab mates, collaborators, about what they ACTUALLY mean when they say X vs my understanding of it. And we end up citing recent papers at each other that are unclear and don't bother defining the terms they're using. So online-only doesn't even have what I need to do my work, even if I did retain math concepts from pdfs.\xa0\n\n\n3) browse by shelf kind of sucks. Yeah I found that feature. It only lets you go a few books in either direction. You can't go up or down. You can't turn around and see that there's even more books on the EXACT thing you were thinking of in the next section behind you -- QH 300 instead of QH 70. Because there's a certain amount of duplication of content. If you want a book on mangrove forests you can go to plants, fish, oceans, coastal systems, ecology, conservation, gis, mathematical biology, community ecology, a specific country/Sea/ocean etc etc etc. all different call numbers and some aisles apart. I spent a lot of time in the Redpath basement going up and down several stacks and my experience in the last few weeks trying to do the same thing digitally has been miserable. Even in the days of cards that was only to find the call numbers, once you were in the aisle you could see all the related books without trying.\n\n\n\xa04) library search sucks. Someone said you can just find what you want in 30 seconds and click a button to reserve it. That hasn't been my experience with the system. It's clunky and doesn't always give good results. I'm not going to rant about that and I don't care if you think I just don't know how to use it and tell me to just click here or there or refine my search a certain way. If it was that easy I wouldn't be paragraphs into this.\xa0\n\n\n\xa05) I've spent a lot of time in library stacks at other institutions and McGill has other options to fit more on site books in the space we already have while keeping the study spaces, which are GREAT.

Most of the search and recommendation algorithms we interact with are geared to give us SIMILAR things, but creativity comes from linking DIFFERENT things together into a new synthesis.\xa0 And on the partial note similar to OP, being unable to interact with knowledge outside an algorithm bothers me a lot. Huge chunks of the library are hidden from me now by putting them offsite and forcing me to either know what I want when I go to the library website or rely on its miserable search results.

This will result in exclusive use of online resources, which for sure will have impact on research and discourse. I think analogous situation is studying latin texts. At some point it was very popular because knowing Latin was required for certain disciplines. Now it's a specialty language, and as such only academics who know it can study ancient texts.\n\n>This is libraries adapting to the 21st century to provide services modern students find useful while minimizing the amount of maintenance they have to do.\n\nThis is a post hoc economic rationale for lowering the quality of an academic environment.\n\nIf the university needs more space for people, then make more space for people. This isn't a mutually exclusive situation, unless the people in charge are willing to cut corners on academia. And they clearly are."", ""I take some of your points, but I also feel like you're either not understanding, or not engaging in good faith with some of the positions I'm trying to argue. I understand that offsite storage conditions are almost certainly better than standard library conditions, my use of the word rot was more a reference to languishing than physical degradation, and I'm sure I could have chosen a better word for the point. To the point on 'having to click on another link', that's very clearly not the point I'm making; I'm not complaining that I have to go through the great task of clicking one more time, I'm complaining that the process for requesting books is  not only not obvious, but pointedly unintuitive; it almost seems as though it is meant to stop you from figuring out how to make those requests. This is specifically and explicitly an accessibility issue, and as a library worker, I'm baffled by your lack of concern about it.\n\nI also don't see the need to keep multiple versions of textbooks on site, but that's not what I'm talking about, and I'm pretty sure you know it. Huge portions of libraries are made up of academic books that have not been digitized, and are unlikely to be digitized, and are not textbooks. Those books, many of which, as you say, have not been checked out in years are gone now, and even less likely to be checked out than ever before. When I go into the stacks to pick up a specific book, I also tend to have a look at the books that surround it. By doing this, I have found a lot of scholarship that I would never have otherwise found, much of which has been extremely valuable for me, and the vast majority of which have likely not been checked out in over a decade. That mode of discovery is utterly lost, as are those books; I cannot imagine that moving books offsite will do anything other than consign many less-cited or well known works to an unseen shelf in robotic storage, never to be requested again. This seems to me to be a much greater waste than shelf space. This is what I mean by rot. The value of these books should not be measured by how often they are taken out, but by their potential to contribute, otherwise, why should the library have bothered to acquire them at all?\n\nThis is also an issue that hits some fields far more than others, and these fields tend to be the ones that are often seen by many as inherently 'less valuable' by many (for reasons that I would explicitly label as anti-intellectual), or are more niche; literature, religious studies, and history, among others, are fields that require texts that are very often not digitized. Likewise, highly specialized sub-disciplines often require reaching back into older literature; I do work around extremism and terrorism, and a lot of the books I end up needing are only available physically. Those books are now more difficult, take longer, and require more overall labor to access, as you yourself have pointed out. I'm not really sympathetic to the 'someone now has to go get and process the books you request' line of argumentation, as that's an issue the university has made for itself. I would have quite happily gone and retrieved those books myself, but I don't have the option anymore, and that extra labor now applies to all non-digitized books throughout almost the entire library catalogue.\n\nAs for this being a conservative argument, I'm really quite curious as to how you've reached that assessment. Personally, I don't see a position that is based on a largely idealistic opposition to the pursuit of financial efficiency, and the dismantling of 'the library' to that end a conservative one, I would in fact argue that this is itself at its core a deeply conservative project, and one that is a result of the increasing shifts within the university as an institution towards being a profit-driven degree farm that constantly increases enrollment numbers without investing in the necessary infrastructure to support those numbers, leading to increased class sizes, stagnant wages for instructors, profs, TAs, and other academic staff, fewer career opportunities for young scholars, the steady dismantling of tenure, and the need to dismantle and offsite libraries once the issue of space becomes as pressing as it has.\n\nTo be honest, and likely in a way that is similar to how you find me top be petulant and conservative, I find it a little hard to believe you're a library worker, and I would be stunned if you claimed that you were a librarian (though to be fair, you have not). I've known a great many librarians, and have spoken at length with a number of librarians here at McGill (all of the ones I've spoken to have been angry with and disgusted by the exact same things that anger and disgust me here), and your attitude towards this process, and books in general is one that I've not encountered, and would make most librarians I know pretty upset. One of the underlying points here is that the thing that is being done is, in a literal sense, the dismantling of a library and the creation of a study space; a different thing, despite a frequent overlapping of the two. That McGill keeps calling it a library doesn't mean it necessarily still is one. I will concede that this is not a claim I can make concretely, as it's a philosophical point that is perhaps somewhat similar (though certainly not identical) to the Ship of Theseus problem, and would require us to agree on what, fundamentally, makes a library a library, a point on which I suspect we would not agree.\n\nIt seems to me that your evaluative philosophy here is primarily instrumental (which, by the way, I would tend to describe as conservative in this context), rather than one that sees the contents of a library as having a value that is inherently tied to it's potential. By your own logic, why don't we just take every edition of every book we have available online, or that hasn't been checked out in a decade, and just throw it on a pyre? It would be a more efficient solution than hiding means of requesting physical copies to drive people to digital ones, and by removing books that would likely only be found through browsing from shelves, we might as well be burning them anyways, for all the future use they're going to see.\n\nAnyways, my apologies for going so overboard with this response (and admittedly getting a little worked up while writing it), it would seem that I don't much like being charged with being conservative."", 'Building is also incredibly capital and energy intensive. Why not readapt space you already have?', 'Yes but have you tried building a new building lately? Tree huggers, NIMBYs, Heritage Building Absolutists, etc will stop you at every turn.', ""The word 'rot' was not intended literally, I'm sure (or at least I certainly would hope) that the storage conditions and protocols offsite are reasonable (and probably better than a normal library), and hopefully archive-grade, though I kinda doubt it, given how expensive archival storage systems can be at scale, as I understand it. If you'd like, you can imagine I used the word 'languish' instead\n\nAnd I very much doubt that any digitization project being undertaken here would be sufficient. Digitization takes a lot of time, costs a fair amount of money, and can be pretty difficult, particularly with older books. Given the sheer number of books in the collection, I very much doubt that ongoing digitization efforts would reach more than a small fraction of the McGill collection. It's something I'd be happy to be wrong about, but I doubt that's the case."", ""If the primary concern at the university was best measured by looking at the number of people who have needs of it, decontextualized of everything else, I'd agree, sure. But that line of argumentation would lead to the valuing of only the undergraduate student experience, as undergrad students massively outnumber both grad students, professors, and other researchers. But that's not actually an accurate reflection of what 'the university' is actually meant to be for, or what it is meant to do. Teaching at the undergraduate level is not the main 'point' of the university, though it is obviously important. Most of what profs do here is actually research, the fact that researchers make up a minority of the population of the community by the numbers doesn't necessarily mean that their needs mean less."", 'Fair, but the need for physical books is different between science and arts.

It's the entire point of the non-educational portion of this institution. \n\nAlso, calling the claim ' it's the death of accessible knowledge' blatantly false, and then justifying that assessment by pointing out that these books will become forgotten is literally the point I'm making? \n\nAlso also, research doesn't just uncomplicatedly 'get replaced' as much as it is built or iterated upon, or further developed. New research doesn't overwrite previous work, it extends it, responds to it, exists in conversation with it, or argues with it. It is a part of a lineage of knowledge development, and erasing the pre-internet portion of that lineage is something that would be extraordinarily damaging to our understanding of knowledge as a whole, and much of the future work that will exist within that chain. There are large numbers of scholars whose work is literally just exploring, theorizing, and learning about these chains of knowledge development; you cannot properly understand where you are if you do not know where you have come from, and there is always the possibility that profound observations and realizations can emerge as a result of studying past knowledge and research."", ""Run.

That was my tasks as a student worker in the library when I was in undergrad!', 'I really do mean this in a sincere way (not trying to dunk, just using the above comment as a segue) but part of the issue here is also that it exemplifies the continued devaluing of the humanities in higher education. The majority of the research in STEM is online, and the majority of research conducted is lab-based anyway, not lit review, so non-humanities students don’t think of physical books as integral to research anymore. But in the humanities, research IS books—monographs, journals, physical indexes of archival material, and quite literally the lifeblood of entire disciplines exists only in books, and due to the nature of digital media being an innovation of the past century at most, if we’re being generous, the vast majority of humanities research does not exist in digitized format. Physical libraries and archives are absolutely integral to humanities research!\n\nA lot of people defending the off-site library project also mention that you can search the catalog and request delivery for any material needed, and no offense to the McGill library staff (they are all lovely people who have helped me out of many tight spots re: locating sources over my degree) but the catalog is DOGSHIT. Books that are not publications from the past ~20 years and/or semi-major works can be super time/labour-intensive to find online despite existing within easy reach on the shelves! I’m not just speaking in the abstract—I have, personally, on more than one occasion, taken out books that I couldn’t check out at the automated kiosks because they were just not indexed in the library system for whatever reason. I’ve had to take books to the desk only to find that they don’t exist in the McGill system because their catalog info has input errors or is outdated due to the book’s age, these same books being unsearchable even within my library account. People bring up the issue of books collecting dust and being checked out on average every 50 years, but it’s easy to dismiss “useless” material until you need it, and we have no idea how many of these ghost books and hidden gems will be lost with an offsite move!\n\nBesides—on a purely philosophical level, is it not kind of depressing that basic access to knowledge is being made so arbitrarily difficult? The whole point of a library is that you can freely access books and that they exist as a repository of human information, regardless of how “useful” that knowledge may seem in the abstract. And sure, people want different things out of university and I get that for some people it will always just be about the degree and entering the workforce, but even without me getting on some doomer soapbox about anti-intellectualism and the death of the humanities, it’s absurd to be told that wanting to go to university for the purpose of going to university (learning things) and wanting basic resources to do so is a waste of space.

Incredible that we live in an era of convenience and automation only to totally deskill ourselves and in the service of “comfort.” Maybe it’s not that deep for most people, but I can’t help but feel the library project is only another step in the dumbing down and corporatization of the university, which like, hopelessly sentimental and idealistic as I may be, should be one of the last institutions we still have that safeguard knowledge for knowledge’s sake and not profit?', 'I have however, spent a great deal of time working and writing in library spaces :)', 'I\'ve been thinking about this comment for a while and I\'ve also been in STEM academia for about 11-13 years depending on how you count different positions and not including undergrad (staff, lab manager/tech, grad level employee-student, now grad student my life is complicated ok).\n\n\nAnd yeah, there\'s a but of discipline specific stuff I kind of agree they\'re, but I don\'t think it\'s humanities vs STEM. Maybe whatever you do in STEM is fine without physical books but I keep trying to figure out how, hahaha.\n\n\nI couldn\'t have done my staff job without access to the library -- I regularly had an array of books and photocopies all over my workspace because the last time anyone worked on/made a major publication on this topic it was 1930 and in German, with one not so great 1960s paper in English and a few SHORT sections in a few textbooks. Another project involved piecing together a topic with key author who published on it from 1905-1925. When I went to the stacks to find these monographs and such I found invaluable textbooks and monographs a few shelves down. I don\'t know how I would have managed this project without the library, even though some of the monographs ARE digitized on BHL and through a network of researchers. I couldn\'t get the information needed to understand them without the other books I found seriendipidously.\xa0\n\n\nEven though now, as when I was a lab tech, I\'m working on cutting edge/emerging tech, I still need to go get out random textbooks and such. My field is huge but intimately interconnected and it\'s impossible to be an expert in everything you need to move it forward. Papers and profs assume you have the background needed to just ""get it"" when mentioning entire fields within fields -- things that were a random vocab word or a single lesson in a 300+ level course. And of course I\'m sure you\'re different but most STEM profs I encounter, especially at research universities, are awful at explaining when you come to them with questions because they are so far down the rabbit hole of their field they don\'t even realize their highly niche knowledge or the highly technical papers aren\'t basic even to a fairly advanced student.\n\n\nI hope your field is different, but my whole experience in STEM has been having to teach myself 85-90% of the knowledge needed to do my job and research. I\'ve taken grad level courses both here and at my last institution on things I\'m currently doing but they aren\'t ""deep"" enough that you can leave them and advance the field as a grad student. I don\'t know how any STEM field COULD have courses that actually bring you up to speed these days. So I go to the library, find a pile of textbooks, monographs, and springer books with titles that were vocab words from my courses (yes even if it\'s CS/coding related), cover my desk in them for a few weeks with sticky notes and red string.....\xa0 THEN I\'m ready to read the current papers, know which R/Python packages are worth my energy, and actually understand what the functions are doing and what settings to pick instead of following the first tutorial Google gives me or a random stack exchange answer. Not that I don\'t do that too.\xa0\n\n\nI think a lot of students in the digital age and especially STEM don\'t even realize there\'s work-smarter-not-harder ways to get knowledge and just feel stupid and imposter syndrome when coming out of meetings with profs. And if nothing else, giving eyes a break from screens is essential.\xa0', "">This isn't a mutually exclusive situation\n\nIt kinda is tho; space is not unlimited"", 'Ok, there’s a lot to go through here, so I’m going to address each of your main points as I understand them individually. I have 8 years of experience in various roles and departments across three academic libraries, and am currently pursuing my second graduate degree. I am not a librarian but am deeply familiar with the functioning of academic libraries. \n\n1) Storage of Books\nYou take issue with books being stored due to them “languishing”, despite being kept (I assume, McGill could be different) in better conditions. Books degrade by being kept in poor conditions and being handled, so by all metrics they’re better off being stored in purpose built storage. You seem to think that the books aren’t languishing as long as they’re visible to the naked eye, but if it hasn’t been checked out in over a decade it really doesn’t matter where it is being kept. \n\n2) Accessibility\nYou mention that to see a physical book rather than the ebook that you have to use a certain filter. This is NOT an accessibility issue provided an ebook is available. This is you being minorly inconvenienced because you want someone to send you the physical copy. \n\n3) Discovery via Browsing\nI saw your second comment, but figured I’d make another point anyway- most people do not find books this way. The grad students I’ve known who use physical books (myself included, I love physical books) find additional sources by looking at references, not by wandering the stacks. \n\n4) Potential to Contribute\nThis seems like a non-issue to me. You make it sound as though these books are being thrown into an incinerator, but if a scholar needs them, they’re a click away. It’s never based upon potential to contribute, but instead off of how often books get used. It’s basic utilitarianism- if a book is using space we want, but we want to keep it, put it somewhere else. To answer your “why bother acquiring them in the first place?” The answer is because they may have been relevant and popular forty years ago but are now outdated, or because they’re useful but extremely niche. \n\n5) The need to dismantle and offsite libraries\nThe need to offsite materials is a simple one- space is in high demand, and there’s only so much space in the building where students go. Libraries serve as a service hub, so they’re a bit of a one stop shop for students and scholars. People don’t want one building which does poster printing, a second that has tech circulation, a third with VR simulation, and a fourth with study rooms. As to dismantling libraries… I’m not sure I understand. Libraries are not being dismantled. Services are being broadened and improved continuously. \n\n6) You seem inflamed by my conservative comment. I hadn’t meant it as a political statement, but rather that you come across as socially conservative, or traditional might be a better word. To be frank, you seem nostalgic for books for books’ sake, not services, spaces, or functions that libraries provide. You seem totally unwilling to hear why libraries can’t serve as anything other than book repositories in the modern age, and because I attempted to explain why, you tell me you have a hard time believing I even work in a library. \n\nI’m not saying books don’t have inherent value. Most library workers love books (myself included) and we don’t enjoy getting rid of them. However, putting them offsite so we can better service our communities is not getting rid of books. They’re just a couple clicks away.\n\nJust a minor point, but I find your implied distinction between library staff and librarians to be incredibly distasteful and ill-informed. Most of us got into library work because of a childhood love of books.', ""Someone has brought to my attention that the library has an online 'browse the shelf' feature, which is actually pretty cool, and somewhat undermines my 'you can't browse now' argument. However, this feature is also (I would argue), both less well known, and probably less likely to be used in lieu of actual browsing, so while my argument regarding that issue is weakened somewhat, I think it still remains reasonably pointed.

As it is, you can request that the library digitize books, in part or in whole, if you need to access them but can't do so physically for whatever reason, but that's an option that only works if it's used sparingly. The library absolutely does not have the capacity to do this at scale. I'm not saying digitization isn't a good thing, because it is. I'm saying that it's not a feasible alternative in the short to medium term.\n\nAlso, I absolutely think a university, and a top one at that, would just abandon their libraries. I'm quite literally arguing that that's what McGill is doing right now. This is not only not a crazy position, but one that acknowledges the realities of the neoliberalization of 'the university' as an institution more broadly; there are universities that are right now shuttering entire departments because they 'don't make enough money', or 'don't have high enough enrollment'. That constitutes an abandonment, regardless of the arguments, justifications, and realities that underly those decisions. McGill being a 'top university' doesn't shield it from these processes; this university has been pursuing austerity policies for a long time now, and many of the issues currently being faced are the result of those kinds of policies and decisions. McGill didn't 'suddenly' start having a space issue for undergrads, they simply continued to increase enrollment without seeking to expand the infrastructure to meet the increased demands those decisions would inevitably lead to. The university is very much in a crisis of it's own making here."", ""Right, and like I said, I'm sympathetic to the study space issue. Grad students here also don't tend to get offices and dedicated grad workspaces, a thing that is pretty much standard everywhere else. But this impacts education as well; this is the kind of thing that will keep some top profs away, or may impact publication schedules and research timelines and the like, which subsequently can impact research funding, which impacts profs and instructors in ways that can significantly impact their capacity to teach. It's a decision that resonates outwards from the more niche complaints to subtly impact and degrade the quality of all sorts of other aspects of the university, including on the educational side.\n\nIt's also indicative of an attitude/tendency by/of the university to respond to issues by contracting rather than expanding; instead of attempting to deal with the issue by building or locating more space, the university deals with it by slashing other services instead rather than making investments that would in the long term expand the capacity and improve the quality of the institution. It's a strategy of decline. This is just one of the more obvious examples of this kind of thing, but it's part of a much more broad and distressing trend of overall disinvestment and dismantling.\n\nEdit: and as for your edit, I don't think your comment was one that requires an apology.

The plan was never to move things off campus and lose space by hiding books out of site and letting them ""rot""; the original plan was based on the University of Chicago\'s cutting-edge model of robotic shelving below ground. But that proved extremely expensive (not to mention logistically complicated on an island) and so it got whittled down to cheaper off-campus storage, which is not as ideal as having everything on site, for sure, but not disastrous. For one thing, professors had literally years to tell the library which books they wanted to keep on campus; they were given massive spreadsheets of books in their fields and asked, with the help of the subject librarians, to come up with lists of things that were useful for their students (including for grad students for comps) and for teaching. Most of what was moved off site was not books per se, but spare copies, things that had not been checked out in years, if ever, and (even more so) periodicals that are already digitized. As to your point about how this affects recruitment of professors, LOL! Most professors at McGill went to Ivy League institutions with much better libraries and McGill\'s library was a big step down for them, which they knew going in.

Regardless, most profs don\'t browse the stacks; they have things delivered to their offices, especially since they rely heavily on Interlibrary Loan. The point is that, while some people enjoy the ""traditional"" library experience, it simply isn\'t the way the vast majority of McGill users make use of the space. McGill is an urban campus and space is at a premium, and therefore they wanted to free up some space for mixed uses, including instructional space, not just turn it into study space for undergrads, though that was certainly part of it.', ""The point here is that removing books from a university library lowers the quality of the academic environment and is long term deleterious to academia. \n\nThe practicalities of how the university manages space is beyond the scope of the discussion because nobody here knows what's really happening behind the scenes and what choices there really are."", ""> 2) Accessibility You mention that to see a physical book rather than the ebook that you have to use a certain filter. This is NOT an accessibility issue provided an ebook is available. This is you being minorly inconvenienced because you want someone to send you the physical copy.\n\nIt is an accessibility issue. I don't see how that's even up for discussion as that is literally what the discussion is about, and does indicate, as the OP mentioned, that you are engaging in bad faith.\n\n> I’m not sure I understand. Libraries are not being dismantled.\n\nLiterally the stacks are being dismantled. What is a library?  \n\n>Services are being broadened and improved continuously.\n\nThis sounds like ominous corporate double speak."", ""I feel like I'm pretty explicitly not making the case that 'internet bad, only old books good'. I also get the vast majority of my literature from digital archives. They're great, and I'm glad they're being expanded constantly.\n\nIt's also pretty amusing that you call me condescending and 'intellectualizing' (this is literally a debate about a university library, university policy, and is at it's core about what the university is and should be on a conceptual level, so I'm not super sure what you're expecting here), while telling me to 'grow up' and realize that universities are businesses, which is both the exact point I was making in my reply and also very specifically the thing I am pushing against here. I'm happy to try and avoid being condescending (lord knows I have a tendency towards doing it), but only if you are too.\n\nI understand that universities have become businesses to some extent, and I see this as a fundamentally bad thing; universities are the last remaining place that has any claim at all to knowledge development that isn't explicitly driven by capitalist interests and profit, and every decision made along the logics of business weakens that claim a little more. I don't think that moving the library catalogue offsite is a singularly damaging thing per se, as much as it is one of the most visible and obvious cases of a long and ongoing series of decisions that each contribute to a broader undermining. And I think that's really bad.\n\nAlso, it's worth noting that the Fiat Lux project was started long before the provincial cuts, so aren't informed by the (awful) financial realities imposed by them."", 'Ok, so much like OP you’re not actually concerned about libraries but about physical books. Dismantling stacks and dismantling libraries are not even close to the same thing. \n\nAlso, I sincerely fail to understand how a book being readily available for request via a library catalog is an accessibility issue. Maybe it’s the American in me, but accessibility is a big topic and issue here that we deal with frequently. \n\nFinally, I love how you imply a corporate connection, as if libraries somehow benefit financially from having to maintain offsite storage and renovate spaces to better serve students.', 'I just feel like you’re upset because you like finding books in the library, maybe it makes you feel more attached to those before you, and it’s ok that you’re upset. But I think this is one of the better projects McGill has had and it’s not a determent to knowledge preservation in my opinion.', ""Seems like we have different definitions of what a library is, and you are engaging in bad faith because you keep refusing to acknowledge the essence of the issue, while simultaneously backpedaling.\n\nWhy are these spaces called libraries? Why not just call them study halls or resource centres? What's the etymology of library?\n\n>I sincerely fail to understand how a book being readily available for request via a library catalog is an accessibility issue.\n\nYes, because you are engaging insincerely. You don't want to state that removing books from immediate physical access, which is what a library is for, is an accessibility issue. I don't think you understand what accessibility is and no conversation is going to change that. \n\nGiving students study space is not mutually exclusive for having books readily available. This was just the decision that was made by the university, but that doesn't make it the only option *in theory*. We don't know what other options were on the table."", ""I mean, yea, that's definitely part of it. It's also a thing that makes me quite sad. Gaining access to a physical academic library was pretty formative for me, and as far as I can tell is kind of a common sentiment for a lot of grad students and profs in mine and similar disciplines. That's gone now, the opportunity to wander through the stacks in awe and realize that any of it could be mine the moment I decided to choose a book. That's going to be gone now. Most people won't have had that kind of experience, but the kinds of people who tend to stay in academia seem to, and this robs them of that experience, and I do worry about what that might mean in terms of impact in the long term.\n\nI think that in this place is ostensibly at its core supposed to be about the development and furthering of knowledge (this also being a part of why universities teach students in the first place - to try and foster the next generation of scholars), and this is something I see as both a substantial material and symbolic move away from that ideal."", 'Oh no, an etymologist!!1!. Whatever will I do?!?1!? \n\nI majored in classics, buddy. You don’t need to tell me what the etymology of library is. I’m not engaging in bad faith, you’re just refusing to say how this is an issue besides “it’s bad”. Please quote where I’m backpedaling and rescinding my previous explanations. \n\nAlso please explain why it’s actually problematic that to request a book you have to use a filter to filter to in library holdings. \n\nYou’re giving incel undergraduate freshman who thinks they know more than employed professional vibes. (That’s an ad hominem, in case you were wondering). If you want to engage in bad faith, we can go there. It’s a slow day at work.', 'My partner is a phD(c). I can tell you this is an over romanticization of academia. Don’t get paid for your time as a researcher, let alone as a TA, don’t get paid enough if you stay on as faculty, male dominant boys club, grad school is usually only accessible to the rich and comfortable (Quebec is a rare case) - the list goes on. I’m sorry you’re disappointed, but this a good move for the hundreds of undergrads who are looking for a third place in a time were isolation is more common then ever. Montreal has the BanQ - I think you’d appreciate that + it’s a gov funded project / library so it’s not going any place anytime soon.', ""Admittedly, that last paragraph was one of the more idealistically naive things I've written in a while, and\xa0 I don't actually have that view of academia when I'm not suddenly struck by melancholy, as much as that is the thing I want academia to be, which is also on its face an unrealistic goal. That said, this is a move away from that. I agree that undergrads need space, I'm just disgusted at what has been given up for it. Not surprised, but disgusted nonetheless.""]",347

1651284363.0,A fond farewell to /r/McGill,"It's been one helluva ride. During my undergrad, I got to experience: 

* Samosa sales before they were banned
* McGill's first snow day in **decades**
* The joy of majoring in a faculty that really has your back and wants you to succeed (Shoutout to the German Studies Department, they're all wonderful)
* A global pandemic (that we all initially thought wasn't going to be much longer than a few months. Turns out it was two years, whoops!)

There were some rough moments. For all of us, really. But even during the height of the pandemic, the /r/McGill community made me feel like I was still going to the university rather than sitting in my room watching lectures and handing in pdfs on Mycourses. 

I'm really happy that I was one of the people who pulled that April Fools switcheroo prank with /r/Concordia, and that I was there to see our banner on /r/place come together :)

1696130700.0,So Lonely...,"I am now in my last year at McGill and I have never been more lonely or depressed. In my years now at McGill I have tried joining clubs, volunteering, going to tutorials, talking to people in class but I have yet to make any meaningful friendships let alone even find a significant other. I quite literally go days without saying a word as I have no one to speak to. I came to Montreal and McGill not knowing anyone here beforehand and in my first year covid happened, but I was optimistic every year that it would get better but it never did. Now I am graduating soon and that thought has been so incredibly saddening as people say university is supposed to be the best years of your life, I cant help but feel that I have missed out but at the same time I dont know where I went wrong. Now I am feeling extremely depressed. I hate this perpetual feeling of loneliness, before McGill I took for granted how important friendships are. Its truly horrible, always studying, eating, sitting alone, no one to hang out with. Anyways... sorry for this tangent it just feels so draining always walking around with this ceaseless sadness and having no one to vent to. Hopefully the students who joined after 2020 will have a far happier time at McGill than I did. ","[""I honestly had to do a double take reading this because this is something I would have written myself. \n\nI hated myself for not being able to make these connections and felt like I was wasting away what were supposed to be formative years having fun and making new friends. Just know it's not your fault and this is just a temporary blip. 2020 left so many people unable to form these connections, and what you're going through now is by no means a reflection of yourself.\n\nif you can take anything from your time just focus on getting your degree and hold your head high in that you were able to persevere through this. Once you graduate you'll be working, joining new communities, and no doubt making new friends.\n\nMcGill is fantastic school if you can find your connection, but sometimes people get caught in the cracks and you're left to get out on your own.\n\nIf I was still at McGill I would go for a coffee with you but the best I can do is offer you to reach out to my DMs anytime even if just to chat throughout this year."", ""Haha you remind me of myself so much. I guess it's reassuring to see that other people are in a similar boat to me.\n\n I'm in my second year. The first year, I was highly motivated to make friends and connections, however as time went on, I realized that it was difficult, everything feels superficial, as if you don't really become friends with people. Anyway, I would have the same conversations with people, asking what my major is, what year, what classes we are taking etc. Eventually it was to the point where I could predict exactly how a conversation would play out. I did have group members whom I worked on projects with but we never hung out after our meetings, everyone just wanted to go home and had their own friends. Outside of school related questions, I wouldn't text anyone and no one would text me.\n\nSo the second year starts and I have zero incentive to talk to people at this university. I mean there's a 99% chance that nothing meaningful is going to come out of a social interaction. And I shit you not, up until today, I have not spoken to a SINGLE person aside from my lab partner. So every day, my schedule consists of going to lectures, not saying a word and immediately going home, to study in isolation. And I am certain for a fact that this is how my entire university experience will go. It's quite isolating and for this very reason I consider a transfer heavily to my hometown university but I tell myself everyday to stay enrolled in this school on the off chance that I'll develop a singular meaningful relationship. \n\nAnyway, sometimes I truly do feel like an imposter because it seems like literally everyone else on campus has a friend or a group of friends, but I guess posts like these reassure me that there are many people in the same boat as us. Probably a lot more than we think, they just never make it known to us"", 'I haven’t been at McGill for a long time (graduated in ‘06), but I felt like this for a large portion of my time in undergrad.

There was no depth at all and I lost touch with them as soon as I left. \n\nIt got better. I made friends in my professional degree. I made friends at work. I built a small social circle and found a partner.\n\nNot everyone makes lasting friendships in undergrad, and that’s ok.

Life isn't objective, so that means there aren't set periods where you're 'supposed' to feel anything. You didn't have fun at university, it wasn't for you or the circumstances didn't foster a good environment, and that's ok! You didn't miss out, you'll have so many more opportunities to connect with people and make friends. And importantly, just because you can't picture this better time in your head right now, doesn't mean an opportunity you can't see isn't there waiting for you!\n\nI just graduated last year, and I had fun during my time at McGill, but I certainly hope that it wasn't my best years! We both have so much life left and so many new stages of life to experience.

OP included.\n\n\\------\n\nNow, honestly, you don't meet lasting friends from going to classes together and studying in the same program (same goes for transient activities like volunteering here and there or professional development based things). Friendships build on common interests and spending time doing things everyone enjoys (or experiencing new together).\n\nClubs are a decent place to start (none of the others will set up that environment) but it also depends on what kind of clubs. A gaming club where you meet people who play Valorant (for example) together will set you up with recurring games (if you take the initiative or get adopted into a group) and eventually into doing other activities together (going out for food, watch parties, hangouts and vacations, etc).  Joining a club for premed or other career development that does info sessions and studying sessions will be harder to form the same effect since it's not tied to personal interest (for most people - you come in talk about work, complain about work, but when everyone finishes their prep there's not much reason to keep talking).\n\nStart by knowing what you like to do, and find people to do those things with you. If your hobbies are nothing but watching shows and YouTube videos then there might be a whole other, bigger problem than being lonely at school.\n\n\\-------\n\nThat said, after undergrad, you might have an easier time in smaller environments like grad programs or work departments.

You received lots of positive feedback and words of encouragement. This is the good side. \n\nI’m 55, ancient on a campus scale! I did my MSc at McGill in the ‘90’s.  I studied full time and worked as a nurse part time.  I was always shy, but at least when you study nursing, you stay with the same cohort, so you get to know people, and have many shared, lived experiences.  That’s not to say that classmates from my undergrad or grad classes became life long friends. Only 2!\n\nWhat I did on my rare hours off: I would go to the Second Cup on St Catherine’s St, and back then, people would just chat with whoever was next to them. I wasn’t really looking for friends, I was just enjoying someone’s company for that time.  Learning about what they were up to. At first it was harder to break the ice, but even that got easier. A true compliment can go a long way. But today, everyone is glued to their phones, which makes approaching people a lot more difficult.  But a lot of those people are on their phones because they don’t want to sit there alone. This is the darker side of social media. (My young nephew just had an entire relationship via text: he asked her out via text. They texted non stop for a few weeks, then broke up via text. )\n\nYears later, my still shy self worked in Saudi Arabia. But I did get invited to people’s homes during Ramadan, and this was very enlightening. I noticed when each girl arrived at the gathering, she started at one side of the room and greeted every person in turn. I thought to myself, I’m going to start doing this, especially when I go back home. I try as best I can. But it definitely forces me out if my comfort zone. Sometimes, I make it a game to see how many people I can chat with. \n\nLet’s go back to the compliment.  It has many uses. Doesn’t it feel good to receive a heartfelt compliment. You changed your shirt last minutes before leaving and you aren’t sure it goes with the rest of your outfit. Then someone gives you a compliment on it. Wow, instant validation. But not just that. That person is probably open to people, they obviously like something about you. It’s an instant icebreaker.  Just try it out…give a few heartfelt compliments today. I dare say you will at least get a smile back. Maybe a thank you. You’ll feel acknowledged. \n\nI’m flying into Montreal tomorrow, and I’ll be shocked if I don’t get and receive at least a couple compliments.

1728408844.0,The issue with the protests,"Alright folks, feel free to educate me in the comments, but I just gotta get this off my chest. 
I believe there is a deep flaw within the protests, which is leading to them actually harming their cause more than they are benefiting it. 

As a third party student whose activities are being disturbed by the protests, I find it difficult to not side with the corporation that is McGill. As a queer, far-left, ACAB, eat the rich person, it really hurts me to do so, but the protests have given me no choice. 

Now let me explain my thought process; upon hearing about the protests, I was immediately taken aback. I didn’t quite understand the relation between McGill and Palestine. Education and curiosity is power tho, so I made sure to inquire with some of the protestors. The demands of divestment etc. albeit being a little naive imo, make some sense. I can understand that people don’t want an educational institution investing in warfare. Now, with the current McGill situation, such a massive cut would be crippling to the university, and would obviously be turned around and further taken from the staff and TAs, with it having a negligible, if even tangible, change to the overall situation in Palestine. 

Which is where I find my issue. Why do I need to incquire to learn the protest’s motivations and demands. Any third party who isn’t willing to go look into it themselves simply sees signs about freeing Palestine, with no relation to the university. No one is shooting people in the name of McGill, why are the protests even here right? Overall, there should be people with pickets and signs about McGill war profiteering if that’s the target issue.
Take the law prof protests. They’re out there waving their flags and pickets, and at an immediate glance you know 1. Who they are, 2. Who they’re protesting. 3. What they want. Having these as the forefront of your protest is vital if you want to get the people who’s lives you’re interrupting to rally to your cause. But picketing with signs saying free Palestine next to a university who’s only financially linked to a company that financially profiting from a war caused by two other parties, doesn’t really make sense to me. 

Obviously I’m not mentioning other demands such as cutting off Israeli scholars and such, as that is obviously in the interests of the warmongers exclusively. And aside from it being frankly racist and judgemental, serves to limit education and progress. Only someone looking to seed hate would ask for the segregation of a people within education.

Anyway, that’s my piece on it. The protests, although there is a spark of positive in their heart, has only caused harm to the cause, and the community due to the poor marketability and picketing of its members. 

Tl:DR:
If I have to ask protesters who they are, what their demands are, and how the cause is even relevant to where they’re causing disturbances, then you’re protesting wrong, sorry :/ This info should all be gleened from a glance at the protest. Not having this readily available simply pushes far-left people like me, the target audience, who would’ve supported the cause, against it.

I would also like to share my thoughts on these protests, not only as a McGill staff member and student who had a daily bird’s eye view of the encampment and protests since day 1, but also as an Iranian who was raised in a very politically active family and community in Montreal with lots of experience in political activism logistics and planning.\n\nI believe that the current Pro-Palestinian protests occurring at McGill have gone off the rails and current protestors have lost most of their credibility for a variety of reasons, mainly because of disorganized or a complete lack of leadership. Using the McGill encampment as an example, the protests had clear messages during its first weeks: ""Free Palestine"", ""Divestment"", ""End the War"". They seemed to have had a good system going, as this protesting model was done in many universities across the globe. They had leaders who handled the media, the ins-&-outs happening in the encampment, the food and water rationings, etc.\n\nHowever, a few months go by, and their marketing strategies took a strange turn. Some new slogans and signage started popping up. Not only more violent and racist texts, but slogans from other social activist groups who are not directly affiliated with the “Free Palestine” movement: Black Lives Matter, Queers for Palestine, Trans Rights, Anti-Capitalism and Marxism, Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, etc. I even saw “Vegans for Palestine”, which baffled me, because of all the activist groups that are unrelated to the Free Palestine movement, veganism is probably my top 5. Nowadays, some of them are even openly showing support for Hamas, Hezbollah, and (this pains me to my core) the Islamic Regime of Iran.\n\nThe “Free Palestine” Movement at McGill lost its core mission statement. Too many people and groups were and are being welcomed into this protest, which I believe is either caused by a complete lack of leadership from the original organizers or there were no leaders to begin with and the protestors were “going with the flow”, which is a huge mistake for any organization and event, but especially for political activism, because tensions and emotions are extremely high.\n\nSpeaking as a Leftist myself, as open-minded and empathetic as we are, one of our biggest flaws is that we don’t set boundaries, and we lack the organizational skills that Conservatives seem to have no trouble with. Say what you want about Conservatives, but they know how to market themselves and their causes, and they have such a knack for logistical organization. One of the biggest mistakes I’ve seen far too often in Left-wing protests is a lack of hierarchical leadership. I understand the reasons for it: many leftist protestors have anarchist philosophies and don’t believe in hierarchies. But every successful business and organization must have a solid leadership group and management. A good protest leader knows the movement’s mission statement, knows the core members of their team and gives them proper orders to run the organization smoothly. Most importantly, they have the discipline to say “no” when it’s needed.\n\nDon\'t get me wrong: if all you want to do is show support to a cause and express your right to protest, by all means, do so. This is one of the many reasons I love Canada so goddamn much. But the protestors at McGill are demanding some kind of administrative and structural change within the McGill system, right? If that\'s the case, then how they\'re doing it is completely wrong and irrational. They\'ve been actively refusing to negotiate with McGill\'s Administration and their ""all or nothing"" attitude is hurting their cause. They are letting their emotions get the best of them and, at this point, I don’t think they know what they are fighting for anymore. It\'s so strange to see these people romanticize the concept of a ""Revolution"" without even thinking of the long-term consequences of one. Most Iranians will agree: Revolution occurs through bloodshed and suffering, and you might not get everything you fought for. True, long-lasting Change must come from within the system, no matter how excruciatingly slow the process is.\n\nAnyway, I don’t know where I’m going with this, but to conclude, I personally no longer support the protesters at McGill for many reasons (total lack of credibility, unwarranted disruption, low emotional intelligence, very hypocritical arguments), but mainly because, no matter how much I want this war to end, I refuse to support anyone who blindly supports the Islamic Regime of Iran. That government completely uprooted and destroyed my family. It is a government that hates its people, where women by law have half the value of a man, where gays are lynched, where protestors are publicly hung. The horror stories that me, my family and friends experienced at the hands of the Islamic Regime is traumatizing, no one in their right mind would ever support such a corrupt government, not even if it advances their cause. I even confronted the person who wrote ""Go, Iran, Go!"" on the Roddick walls and warned them that if they continue showing support to this Regime, they will lose all credibility and support from the Iranian community here, and they just stared blankly at me. And what hypocrites these protestors are! They want to cut off all ties from Israeli scholars and education? By that logic, they should also cut ties with Iranian scholars, right?\n\nAnyway, sorry for the rant, I kind of went off tangent there. It’s been increasingly emotionally exhausting to come to McGill every day.\n\nPS: is anyone else annoyed as hell by another one of their slogans “Genocide is Not Okay!”? No shit, it’s not ok! They couldn’t come up with anything better? It’s as if someone from the Kardashian family came up with that shit.\n\n\xa0', ""thank you for writing what I've been thinking.  I'll be following this post to hopefully learn and make some sense of what seems like senseless destruction and disruption to me."", 'Basically yeah, I share a lot of identities and positions with you. Every time I find myself agreeing with admin even a little I die a little.\xa0\n\n\nAnd it\'s exhausting to have to learn enough about index funds and university finances to hopefully go out and picket with them but with a more useful sign just to find out a bunch of the talking points are either false (re: tuition not even going into the endowment) or are so mind bogglingly vague like ""Metro grocery is \'complicit\' / (the class we\'re blocking entry to) is \'complicit\' / everything is \'complicit\' etc etc "" that it\'s hard to find any definition for ""complicit"" when it ranges from carrying hummus to literally selling bombs.\xa0\n\n\nThen I talk to some of them about this and nothing short of absolute perfection is good enough. There\'s no middle ground or compromise on any of the demands. Metro = Lockheed Martin. Hummus = Bombs.\n\n\nEven asking questions and expressing doubt in the whole BDS package or mentioning ""tuition isn\'t in the endowment"" gets me called a ""genocide sympathizer"" or ""Zionist"" as if they know me or my politics. I\'ve talked to a lot of other lefties and anticapitalists who have the same experience with these protests.\n\n\n\xa0So I think a lot of it is definitely having the opposite effect. I don\'t think just ""talking about the issue"" is enough, especially online. Oh boy a Reddit thread big success we saved the world. If the people in need aren\'t receiving any tangible or meaningful assistance while people who could\xa0 help either talk about ""whether it\'s a good protest / index funds / the police horse\'s sweet visor"" or distance themselves from people who throw Molotov cocktails and actively don\'t engage the issue at all.', ""The real issue with these protests is they are a complete and utter tactical failure.\n\n\nWhat is the point of this protest? If it's getting McGill to divest, they haven't. The protests at francophone universities did succeed in getting divestment, SPHR failed because they failed to negotiate. They got extremely lucky that the encampment lasted as long as it did, and turned that early success into failure.\n\n\nNot all publicity is good publicity. Getting Gaza in the news by making your cause look bad is not the win protestors seem to think. If you annoy and alienate your supporters and allies, where does that get you? I've watched a lot of average Canadians who are horrified by what Israel was doing be disgusted by the tactics of the protestors that they lose focus on Gaza. That's the opposite of raising awareness!\n\n\nThere is this weird trend in modern social justice acitivism where activists somehow think both (a) my cause is so just that the ends justify the means; and, (b) it doesn't matter if I achieve my ends at all. - That's just an incoherent attitude. If you care about Gaza that should mean accomplishing something. If all you do is make noise snd hurt your cause, this is really all about you and not them, isn't it?"", 'This ""poor marketability"" argument doesn\'t make a lot of sense - people should only protest topics that can fit on a picket sign? If a demonstration makes people educate themselves on an issue, as happened with you, then it has accomplished its job.\xa0\n\n\nProtests also aren\'t always a demand for action, they can be a show of support - I think a lot of people yesterday weren\'t specifically calling for McGill divestment, but were there to join the global calls for a ceasefire, de-escalation, and improved conditions for Palestinians. There is also a small shitty minority who are using the war to push the narrative that Israel should not exist. You often have different groups with various levels of extreme-ness coming together, which makes it even more unreasonable to expect them to present a clear message.\n\n\nRegarding divestment crippling McGill financially... I don\'t think anyone expects the university to sell off it\'s investments and burn the money. McGill can redirect the funds to other investments that might have slightly lower rates of return, but we have a $1.8 billion endowment, I think we can manage. Obviously losing a few tens of millions in investment isn\'t going to affect Israel, but you need to look at the bigger picture. If many institutions pull their investments and boycott, Israeli companies and civilians will be more likely to pressure their government for a ceasefire. These protests also show the governments of Canada and (much more importantly) the US that some of their voters really care about this conflict, which should incentivize them to prioritize finding a peace deal.', 'I want campus open but wtf are you on about for the financial part. Divesting doesn’t mean we just throw out $500000 or however much is invested. Depending on exactly how/when McGill invested, I doubt they’d lose any money at all moving those funds elsewhere\n\nDivesting from weapons companies is such an obvious choice that McGill has even said that they are open to considering it (a very weak commitment, but they sure as hell aren’t arguing it would financially ruin them because that’s complete horseshit)\n\nA vast majority of McGill students probably don’t support the protests at this point, you don’t need to use bad faith arguments to make a popular point', 'putting what you said about clear demands aside (altho imo i think they’ve been incredibly clear given how much of an internet presence this movement has) i think its much more useful to direct your dissatisfaction with how things are going (disruption to your activities etc) towards the mcgill admin who has the power to end these disruptions if they come to the table with serious steps they’re going to take to divest and uplift palestine. we are one of canada’s biggest and richest universities…so saying our influence in this movement is “negligible” is strange. \n\nas for “why do i need to inquire to learn the protest’s motivations and demands”- the whole point of a protest is to capture people’s attention so they DO inquire about these things, so they make the EFFORT to inform themselves. if some issue is producing such a serious reaction from people, it must be a pretty fucking big issue. why do you expect to understand the full nuance of an issue from a few protest signs? when the TAs were on strike they didn’t hold up banners listing point by point every -single- one of their demands and every -single- one of their grievances, they protested using some clear and succinct statements to capture the public and administration’s attention so the more serious discussion can be had. the more detailed information on what they were asking for was found on their major platforms. \n\nits also important to acknowledge here that the “free palestine” movement statement has become a kind of general slogan to represent the overall plethora of issues happening around this issue (geographical, political, economical), just like how “Black Lives Matter” applies to a variety of issues including police violence, prison abolition, income and housing segregation, uplifting black voices etc, all of which intersect and are the result of an overarching oppressive system. protestors are applying it here because the money mcgill is filtering into this war is playing a part in preventing a free palestine.', 'That\'s a lot of words to blather on about why you don\'t understand the cause behind the protests. I think it\'s been articulated quite clearly on the streets, in social media, etc.\n\nI think the core argument is fairly clear: McGill should not be investing in arms companies that have fueled an ongoing humanitarian crisis which has killed 40 000 people, including 11 000 children. (And obviously the events of Oct 7th were atrocities too.) They also should not invest in other more benign companies which are established on illegal settlements in the West Bank that every other country in the world agrees is [illegal](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2017/06/israel-occupation-50-years-of-dispossession/). You can read an entire [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRAGXKCqTl0MwbkuagKGhD45vv3uhjk2a1ZWmhMHLKHmtrKeJxB6E3r5BEGC1_lpQ31-hU9QpbPGVaD/pubhtml) about what companies the protesters are demanding McGill divest from, with a list of reasons.\n\nWhether you agree with all aspects of the protests or their tactics, I don\'t think anyone on any side learns anything from what you just wrote here.\n\nFinally, you write about the disruption of education and ""progress"", and you\'re right--education has been disrupted. It\'s worth thinking about how in Gaza, no universities remain standing. It\'s a privilege you still get to be educated, and it\'s a privilege everyone should have.', '[deleted]', ""Young Padawan, you fail to realize that what you just did there (i.e. creating another topic/thread) is PRECISELY one of the goals of ANY protest or demonstration.\n\nThey piss you off because you can't have your daily routine the way you usually do? That's called DISRUPTION, and that's yet ANOTHER way of catching people's attention. Ultimately, from the point of view of ANY disruptions caused by ANY protest, it doesn't matter if you understand or not what's going on. Your venting about it to family, friends, classmates, workmates, etc keeps the issue being debated alive.\n\n  \nAlso, choices abound. When someone say 'I have no other choice' and the like, it simply means they've already made theirs."", '[removed]', 'You won’t learn anything new, it’s just senseless disruption. Anyone that agrees with it makes the worst arguments known to man.\n\nYou’ll see a lot of “Gaza has no more universities, so the protest give people a small taste of what that’s like” or “they want divestment” (which wouldn’t make a dent in how much money Israel has). They’ll never bring up the messed up or violent acts that have been done for this protest, like the molotovs at Concordia, barricading the administration inside a building, finding where a member of the administration lives and threatening them outside their house, breaking windows of local businesses and Concordia, the encampment that was apparently full of drugs and many other things.\n\nAnd they’ll keep claiming that it’s mostly students even though actual students are most likely studying for midterms right now and when they finally checked the encampment there were almost no students present. 90% of students don’t care about the situation in Gaza, and only growing annoying and resentful by the protest being so disruptive.', '""Regarding divestment crippling McGill financially... I don\'t think anyone expects the university to sell off its investments and burn the money. McGill can redirect the funds to other investments that might have slightly lower rates of return, but we have a $1.8 billion endowment, I think we can manage."" Actually, that is LITERALLY what the protesters want McGill to do. McGill has already offered to gradually move to an investment portfolio that dumps stocks in weapons manufacturers and that offer was rejected as insufficient. Re: the endowment, you don\'t just start spending it. When a university does that, it\'s a signal that it is in financial crisis and this causes cascading negative financial consequences. McGill was already warned by Moody\'s that its outlook was trending ""negative"" because of the province\'s new tuition policies (Moody\'s fully downgraded Concordia\'s rating). This means that McGill will get less favourable interest rates when it goes to borrow money, which it needs to do to cover financial commitments, especially on infrastructural projects. The university will have to pull back on other expenses like salaries and amenities. Again, students lose out, as they get fewer services, their courses get bigger, and the university can offer less aid.', ""It is not a bad faith argument to point out the financial impact. Have you actually looked at SPHR's demands for divestment? They want McGill to immediately pull out of its investments in several Canadian banks, not just weapons manufacturers, as well as companies like Metro grocery stores because they stock Israeli hummus. Most of McGill's investments are indirect anyway, in index funds that bundle stocks together. If McGill were to cave to these demands, rather than instituting a gradual shift to a different investment portfolio, there would be financial penalties in addition to the lost income these investments generate. And those shares would be immediately bought up by someone else, because plenty of investors have standing orders for them. McGill is projecting up to $90 million in losses in the coming years because of the provincial government's new tuition clawback scheme. One of the first things to go, should they have to dip into the endowment or if they lose investment revenue on it, will be in-course scholarships. So the institution loses money and students lose money. And the impact on the war is negligible if non-existent."", 'Divesting in all indirect investments to Israel eliminates the majority of index funds out there. This exposes McGill to a lot of Idiosyncratic risk for their investments', 'You’re passionate about McGill divesting but don’t even know how much they have invested or in which companies. You can strengthen your argument against people like the commenter below you by researching these things and presenting it more cogently.', 'The issue with the core argument is that McGill’s investments in arms companies probably gives Israel a negligible amount of money relative to how much they need/gave while it gives McGill a pretty good amount since they’re literally losing money recently. So wanting McGill to divest is purely based on one’s own values of not wanting to attend a school that’s investing in arms companies, it doesn’t help the situation in Palestine at all. Financially, it would change nothing in Israel and harm McGill’s ability to provide a good education. This protest is not pro-Palestine, it’s anti-McGill.\n\nUsing disruption and violent methods such as breaking windows at Concordia for something that only benefits their wishes but does absolutely nothing for Palestine is selfish and disruptive to other students.\n\nNow to your last paragraph, I’ve seen many people say this on this subreddit and it’s so backwards. Yes, the fact that there are no universities left in Gaza is a tragedy. A solution to that is not to disrupt and cause property damage to every other university in the world. It is also not good logical or moral reasoning for doing so. Two wrongs don’t make a right, and again this isn’t helping the situation in Gaza, it’s just causing an annoying, at times dangerous, situation in Montreal. A real solution would be to donate to charities that aim to secure Palestinian education or spreading awareness online. These protests are causing resentment by people who were originally apathetic towards the situation.', 'Thank you for linking me some more relevant information as to the wants and needs to the protest. I also hope this doesn’t come off as me being anti-protest. I’m French, protesting is in my blood lmao. I agree that education has no reason to mix in with weapons or warfare to any degree.\n\nHowever, I would like to emphasize that having the necessity of going and correcting people’s view on the protest highlights my issue with the protests. If I need further explanations or research to understand the cause, wants, etc. of the protest, then there is a vital flaw with how the protest is being conducted. Realistically (whether we like it or not), the majority of people won’t go and inform themselves on the reasoning, nor will they make an effort to contact involved members and learn. The average person simply sees a group of people causing property damage and disturbing an educational institution under Palestine’s name.\n\nThis is not a great look, and has the sole effects of making McGill seem like a martyr and alienates the cause from the people it’s trying to reach. If I have to receive outside explanations about McGill investments etc, then the protest has already failed. This is the information that should be on the pickets, this is the mantra that should be chanted. McGill isn’t directly oppressing Palestine. So protesting as if it is, is simply pushing people away from the cause. An interim oppression via finances is no Bueno I agree, but the protest should be putting that information to the forefront of their campaign.', 'Yes, after making an active effort to inform myself. There in lies my issue. The average person will make no effort to inform themselves, so why not make this information the forefront of the campaign?', 'Oh absolutely, however, to the apathetic and uninformed, which is to say the average person, people will not be ranting and promoting your cause positively. On the contrary, you become the bad guy in this situation. Effectively rallying for McGills cause instead of your own. \n\nDisruption during a protest is important, but so is clarity on the cause, wants, and relationships of the party. Otherwise, the line between beneficial disruption and harmful disruption gets blurred', ':/ this is exactly what I mean. I’m neutral on the issue, and make a post regarding my views on the topic. Instead of making efforts to educate and improve, these are the responses. How do you hope to get people to join your cause when aggression is your response to neutrality? Doing so only pushes possible recruits into the arms of the party you’re protesting. I believe pressure is necessary, and am pro protests. But when a neutral party tries to learn about the cause and is instead greeted with hostility, well, you might aswell get a paycheck from McGill for all the people you’re pushing to their side.', 'Why are you complimenting cops? OP is making way too much sense to be one.', 'So far I’ve learned nothing.. shame OP is getting roasted rather than educated like they asked.  I too would like to learn more about what these protests hope to accomplish and how they intend to accomplish their goals through the means I’ve seen demonstrated thus far.  Still waiting for anyone to write a comprehensive explanation', 'your reply assumes mcgill hasn’t already engaged in divestment - they did so in december in divesting all their direct holdings in carbon underground 200 fossil fuel companies and they did so in the 1980s in divesting from south african holdings. even assuming any financial impact, as someone who has been heavily funded by in course scholarships, if me needing to take out an extra loan means even one less weapon ends up being produced and used by israel to kill a civilian i’m more than willing to bite that cost.\n\ni want to also note that divestment doesn’t mean a) that the process should occur overnight or b) that mcgill’s portfolio suddenly ceases to exist. demands for divestment (including that of SPHR) call for portfolios to be rerouted to institutions not complicit in funding israel. nor is anyone (including SPHR) directly protesting for mcgill to divest from metro - their demands are aimed at arms manufacturers (like lockheed martin) who have the most blood on their hands.\n\nfor your reference, here is the actual list of demands for divestment: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRAGXKCqTl0MwbkuagKGhD45vv3uhjk2a1ZWmhMHLKHmtrKeJxB6E3r5BEGC1_lpQ31-hU9QpbPGVaD/pubhtml', 'You have a point that I fully agree with, including meaningful details that make an honest discussion point. OP does not actually discuss any of this and only vaguely gestures to divestment from warfare\n\nIt might sound pedantic, but I still feel it was a bad faith argument to begin with, even if there is truth behind it. If I take OP’s description at face value, if we consider the most public demand that most students are aware of, it’s not particularly controversial to want divestment from Lockheed Martin, and McGill has already hinted that this could be on the table (even if it’s posturing)\n\nWhile this is very debatable, in my view, as with most strikes/protests, secondary demands should be treated as secondary. We have a very different situation if McGill agrees to the more popular and lower-consequence demand, then the protestors continue anyway. That said, given some now-deleted instagram posts, I can see why they aren’t getting the benefit of the doubt about finding a compromise\n\nUltimately, as pointed out in other comments, it was a low-effort post that aimed to direct the conversation away from anything nuanced and informative by parroting easy points with little to back it up, and that’s why I call it bad faith', 'Ehhhhh. There\'s PLENTY of ways to move that kind of money around that doesn\'t hurt the money and plenty of investments out there with high returns that aren\'t linked to what\'s happening. The hit is negligible at best if done correctly, and pretending it\'s not is a silly diversion from their simple refusal to acknowledge the demand. \n\nFor instance: there are obviously penalties and taxes associated with moving everything at once. If McGill made a good faith effort to move what it *can* without non-negligibly hurting the school\'s endowment, and said okay here\'s a timeline for moving the rest and it hurts us all if we move it faster, I guarantee you those protesters would see that as a win. Have the damn conversation, don\'t just say ""bbbbbut muh penalties!"" and leave it at that.\n\nThe issue is MORE the blowback from divesting and you know it.', 'I’m not at all passionate about McGill divesting. I am not out there protesting and don’t want to be. So chill the strawman. Enough has been said about protestors going too far, so I only really argue with people that try to defend McGill in unreasonable ways\n\nI’m aware of the gist of BDS and don’t follow it myself. I mentioned this in another comment, but the main demand is still something that even McGill isn’t low enough to pretend is financially infeasible. I’m not SPHR or something and I’m not asking for the other demands of say cutting ties with Israeli institutions, and OP only vaguely gestures at investment in warfare. I think it’s reasonable to say this implies the main talking point that all parties have acknowledged about literal weapon companies, rather than some of the more extreme ancillary demands', 'Come on man. This argument can be used for anything else too. Why recycle when other people pollute? Why be nice when the world is mean?

You realize that, right?', '[deleted]', ""Again, it's not about if people will side with the protesters or not. It's about ATTENTION. Those who really give a damn for the issue are already involved in the cause in one way or another. More may join but for that to happen people have to keep discussing the matter. No protest expects people to suddenly understand all the intricacies of what they're fighting for (or against); they expect people to talk about it and keep spreading the word, no matter which word it is. They expect to make the average people angry and frustrated because they can't get to work. They expect that the number of people complaining will draw media attention, which may lead to pressure on politicians, which may lead to this/that form or action/measure.\n\n  \nAnd yes, some people will get interested enough that they will start reading about where the issue is coming from and why it is or should be relevant. But that's just bonus. As I pointed out, the main goal of any protest or demonstration is get attention.

Mission accomplished."", ""Protests aren't generally meant to be informative, they're meant to be disruptive. Using a protest as an information dissemination tool is pretty inefficient, when you think about it; only the few people who actually happen to be nearby and see the protest have the opportunity to learn, and most of them aren't going to pay attention anyways. Protests, particularly the ones we've been seeing here, are meant to be disruptive. They are meant to increase the cost of engaging in the practices being protested against, and in doing so, apply levels of pressure not normally available to the public outside of mass mobilization. This is also not a level of disruption that comes from nowhere; students spent all of last year trying to navigate more 'legitimate' channels, or engaging in less disruptive actions like hunger strikes, and McGill just ignored them. Protesters are doing the things they're doing now because they already tried everything else that was available to them, and McGill refused to budge.\n\nThe broader point of the thing, though, is that at this point not divesting from weapons companies has almost certainly cost McGill more than the value of those investments themselves, and those costs are going to continue to rise both monetarily and reputationally. Y'all may be finding yourselves feeling alienated by the protesters, but a lot of people outside the university have noticed what's been going on here; a huge academic conference, perhaps the largest in Canada, moved offsite this summer because of, in part, the actions of the university in response to protesting and labor organizing on campus, and McGill is gaining a reputation for severe repression of student activism, certain forms of political speech, and academic labor organizing (the common theme here being that the administration at McGill immediately defaults to repressive strategies when faced with anything it doesn't like). These are things that hurt an institution like McGill, and actually matter more in the long run than a bunch of already unengaged students getting pissed off at protesters."", '[deleted]', 'At least you are willing to admit that taxes and financial penalties are involved, I\'ll give you that.

They shift the goalposts constantly. ""Good faith"" involves both sides finding a middle ground. So far, all I see is the protesters claiming to be willing to negotiate, but then refusing to accept anything less than the totality of their demands. That\'s certainly their right.

It’s causing disruption and many of the acts in the name of the protest have been destructive. Recycling and being nice don’t do that. It’s not easy like recycling, people have been putting lots of effort into the protest, basically wasting a lot of time. \n\nAnd while recycling may have negligible effects in the grand scheme of things, it still has some small benefits like keeping the local environment (like your nearby park) tidier, and it has no downsides unlike the protest where even if they do get exactly what they want, the effect remains negligible on Palestine but the effect is a noticeable loss of money for McGill. In other words, there’s quite a few downsides to it, unlike recycling.\n\nAlso, I don’t think the world is mean, I don’t know why that’s your example. I think it’s a very neutral place. Sure there’s a lot of bad, but there’s also a lot of good.\n\nTL;DR: Recycling and being nice are easy and not time consuming, have no downsides (like disruption), and can have small benefits to one’s personal life. The protest is large waste of time and effort, has many downsides currently, and even more if they do get exactly what and only makes the protesters and everyone around them have harder lives.', 'My argument boils down to it’s one of the best ways for a company or university to make profit to the point that almost every major company, university and government invests into it.

If people really cared they would boycott the big rich companies that are invested in the same weapons companies like Microsoft and Apple.

Makes more sense to force the RBC to stop acting as the middle-man."", 'i understand where you’re coming from - \n\nfrom my understanding, RBC is apart of the divestment goals outlined by SPHR not just because they have invested in israel but because they Significantly invest (like to an incomparable extent) in technology (surveillance systems) that is enabling israel to track down, watch, and kill civilians. all of that is to say, rbc is on the list bc it’s exceptional in its investment to the “naughty companies” (as you put it) and mcgill divesting would likely send a signal to other institutions with shares in RBC to divest which, in turn, would place direct pressure on RBC itself to divest. the reason why students are calling for mcgill to divest rather than going to rbc directly is because mcgill logically has a more proximate obligation to listen to its students and their demands than rbc does. we have to remember that we’re talking about the demands of a student group here, not the general population- so it makes sense that their demands are leveraged against the university. \n\nfrom the document (there’s a further citation in the document itself for where this info is sourced from):\n“RBC have significant (worth 58 billion US) shares in Palantir, a mass surveillance system that provides Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools to the Israeli military for surveillance of Palestinians. These systems “circumvent warrant procedures”, providing military and police forces with “vast amounts of information” about civilians”', 'McGill hasn’t actually offered *anything* concrete so we don’t have hard evidence that the protestors won’t discuss a compromise. Good faith includes not portraying one side as absolutist when neither side has conceded anything', ""They offered gradual divestment? Did they give a timeline and explain the penalty structure? And did they offer not putting a single cent more INTO those investments? If so then the protesters should have been happy with that, yeah. Immediate withdrawal often has *insane* financial consequences for many investments.\n\nApologies if the above is actually the case. I haven't been following as much as I should have to respond in that way. If it is, I'm pretty much on your side."", '[deleted]', 'So, in other words, it is not at all like the targeted divestment McGill has engaged with in the past. It includes divesting from one of the major banks in this country and holdings therein, along with a plethora of companies that simply do business in Israel.', 'One side has repeatedly offered to meet with protesters and made them a concrete offer of a review of investments, and the other side has explicitly rejected it (see SPHR\'s instagram for their ""response to McGill\'s recent proposal""). You can criticize the university for being bureaucratic and slow, and that\'s fair, but this is how universities work. There is a process in place for making an ""expression of concern."" They cannot blow up their procedures for one particular group or cause because where would that end? They have even said they will expedite the necessary review. I have not been able to find any evidence that SPHR or any of the other student groups involved in the encampment or protests have actually filed the necessary expression of concern. (I\'d like to be proven wrong, so if anyone has evidence that it has happened, please pass it on.) You may disagree with what McGill has offered, or think it\'s a weak offer, but it\'s an offer. The other side has offered... nothing. All they have done is promise to continue the same the same harassment, vandalism, and nonnegotiable demands under the banner of ""no peace"" until they get what they want. That\'s not ""good faith"" negotiating. That\'s throwing a tantrum, at best.', 'My understanding is that they offered an expedited review of investments in weapons industries by the Committee on Sustainability and Social Responsibility, which evaluates expressions of concern on the basis of ""social injury,"" to put to the Board of Governors, which signs off on the university\'s investment strategy. You can find the procedure here: https://www.mcgill.ca/boardofgovernors/files/boardofgovernors/cssr\\_procedures\\_for\\_reviewing\\_expressions\\_of\\_concern.pdf. They continued to go forward with this despite ending negotiations with the encampment representatives, who rejected this offer in no uncertain terms. They also asked for community perspectives on the issue, and the deadline to submit them was October 1. The Board of Governors meets only a few times per semester (next meeting is tomorrow!), and I imagine this is on their agenda. If they agree, then they\'ll be working out a more concrete timeline.\n\nLook, this process is (admittedly, frustratingly) slow. But it\'s slow for a reason: they have to apply the review procedure equally to every expression of concern to avoid the university\'s finances being weaponized against it or used toward certain causes over others. Ironically, they may go ahead with divesting from arms manufacturers distinctly NOT in response to the pro-Palestinian protests, but because the Committee on Sustainability and Social Responsibility simply recommends it to put an end to the ""social injury"" these companies commit.', '“Especially OP as a leftist”, this whole left vs right thing is annoying, people have different views on each little thing in the world. Just because most of their views are left-leaning it doesn’t mean he needs to conform to every left-leaning view. I guess it probably means you assume I’m a right winger or something just because think this one protest is dumb, which I am not fyi. That was an unrelated mini-rant sorry. Back to the actual discussion:\n\nIt’s kind of something you have to accept though. A lot of our governments money is allocated to military and arms manufacturers, most companies are invested in it. You could disagree with the concept but it’s not stopping and it won’t change until we have world peace. All this money is going towards killing others eventually. It’s sad but that’s the state of the world. If a war broke out in Canada, which is extremely unlikely, those same investments we all dislike right now would be the same ones keeping us safe.\n\nRefusing to accept this and causing violence downtown as a tantrum is not morally acceptable to me. Causing violence for anything but self-defence is unacceptable to me.', 'It’s certainly not good faith negotiation from SPHR, that’s a very separate idea from what I said. I read SPHR’s response back then, but you seem to only be taking McGill’s response at face value that they’ve offered loads of discussions. Pretty much anyone striking/protesting McGill had consistently criticized the administration for being unresponsive as shit (TAs, law profs, I don’t think SPHR is just making this up). We don’t have to want to break windows to still feel that McGill did not make any real concession', '[deleted]', 'Portraying the other side as not negotiating is a bargaining tactic, which helps explain both the TAs\' and the law profs\' public statements. In fact, in the case of the latter, you might be surprised to learn that the law profs recently told a Quebec judge that productive negotiations were still happening with the university, which was then claiming that negotiations had broken down, in order to avoid being forced into binding arbitration! (The judge ruled against the law profs and ordered arbitration.)  In other words, why assume that McGill admin is the only ""bad faith"" actor when it comes to negotiations? Why not assume that everybody is, in fact, posturing to get what (or at least most of what) they want? Regardless, in terms of optics, McGill has made a seemingly reasonable (if bureaucratic) offer that the protesters have rejected. If SPHR isn\'t representative of McGill students\' opinion on this issue, why didn\'t another more neutral student group distance itself from their tactics, step forward, organize the ""expression of concern,"" and force admin to live up to its offer? That seems to have never happened. I\'d like to believe that most students who support this cause are not as extreme as SPHR, but they have been allowed to set the tone (and the terms) of the discussion.', 'Well, I’m recommending you accept it. It’s not something I’m happy about, I think world peace would be literally the best thing ever. However, people are too stupid for that to happen.']",328
1682618379.0,Going out with a bang,"Following u/Staiinn ’s intriguing experiment about pulling an all-nighter before a final, I decided to give a it a try… After all, what could go wrong, it was only worth 70% of the grade. And I hadn’t studied or attended class 2 or 3 times since the midterm. 

And so, armed with 3 dragonfruit flavoured red bulls I began my work in the evening, dutifully reading the online manual, until I got it done around 11pm. I then went over to the PowerPoint slides, and, lo and behold, the chapters had NOTHING to do with the material. “Nothing to worry about”, I thought innocently, “I’ve got time”. Oh how wrong I was. By 3am, I was a shadow of my former self, harried by “viva la vida loca” blasting on repeat out of my neighbour’s window and the voices in my head whispering about Long run average curves, marginal costs and Nuñez’s game theory for some god forsaken reason. I had been broken, shattered. I stepped in front of the mirror for a little refreshment, and what stared back at me was an unrecognizable mess, sporting a maniacal grin and a tinge of folly in his bloodshot eyes. I felt like Harry Potter discovering his snake speech, except my holy connection was cemented with the much cooler McLennan rats.

And that’s when I had my epiphany: “f*** it (I don’t know if I can swear on this sub), I’ll just f****** wing this b****”. 

And so, with a twisted mind and way too much caffeine flowing through my pulsating veins, I put on the absolute worst drip possible: old blue and greasy sweatpants and a red team Canada hoodie, crowned with a cap to hide my warcrime of a hairdo; walking up to the sports complex I felt reborn, unstoppable, RISE by mako tearing my eardrums to shreds in the process. 

Sat down, grabbed my pencil with the might of god himself, and ABSOLUTELY. FUCKING. DESTROYED. that exam. SUPLEXED. ROUND-HOUSE KICKED IN THE GONADS IF YOU WILL.

NEW SUMMER, NEW ME BABY. MAKE LIFE YOUR B****, MCGILLIANS. I KNOW YOU’VE GOT THAT DAWG IN YOU. DONT GIVE UP. IF A DUMBASS LIKE ME CAN LEARN AN ENTIRE CLASS WORTH OF CONTENT HIGH ON CAFFEINE YOU CAN RULE THIS DAMN PLANET.

I must thank u/Staiinn for showing me this holy path and also for making me lose a lot of neurons, which I’ll probably never recover.

All of these things will likely have greater death tolls than the virus itself over the next few years. The situation itself has no real solution, and it's not evident at all that enforcing draconian restrictions on the social lives of kids will have net positive effects on the number of lives saved."", '[deleted]', ""This is completely off topic, but that's a pretty cool proverb.

I’m saying it’s super selfish to go out and not wear a mask especially when kids themselves cough all over the place and are known to spread germs amongst each other very quickly. I’m sorry but, a parent who says their kids mental health will be affected simply because of a mask covering their mouth and nose is selfish especially when you think about how many of those kids have friends in their class whose sole guardians may be currently sick (cancer included) and super vulnerable to covid which could accelerate their deaths and leave those kids as orphans.
