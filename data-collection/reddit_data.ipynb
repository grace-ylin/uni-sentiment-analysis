       "'to the student who got caught using ai on their exam at u of t law thanks a lot you dumb f*ck. due to your idiocy and dumbassery my college (not in ontario) is now cracking down on access to our hard drives during exams, so now we have to print everything which will be a lot of time and money i don’t have. if you’re too incompetent to write a law school exam and require ai then you shouldn’t even be in law. thanks for ruining it for every other college across the country. it’s crazy that there’s people mad at you for venting. gaining access to your hard drives feels like a huge violation of privacy? i’m surprised that’s even allowed. ? [removed] what canadian says \"college?\" sighs, sounds exhausting. best of luck oof. i only use ai for helping me understand concepts (and actually backing up what it says with sources). idk why so many ppl use it to write their papers for them. it’s not that hard to write your own ideas! thanks to the idiot who got caught, there won’t be future dumb fucks who don’t get caught and go on to practice law. is paper the best solution? no, but y’all are lawyers, i didn’t expect a creative solution. this is a catch all at the harm of most, just like the justice system… 🤬🍞🥖 off topic but i’ve never heard anyone call the university of toronto, or any university, “college.” access to hard hardrives during exams... what on earth rant is this? \\n\\nyou need to print things now? when did you stop? when i was in 1l we didn’t have access to our hard drives anyway so honestly suck it up + skill issue i go this law school and when we heard we assumed it was an undergrad who did it because it’s absolutely unbelievable\\xa0 by college, you mean cegep? who got caught? how about who used it, period? even if you’re not getting caught have some moral scaffolding. it seems to me that people who are fixated on semantics may have been butthurt by this post because they know they have been overly reliant on ai and now can’t survive a day without it. probs also used it to cheat in school lol there, there. that\\'s insane i don\\'t understand what the point of going to school and using ai for work and assignments even is. if you don\\'t care to learn and put in the effort why are you in school. especially in law is crazy. i truly have no respect for people who cheat on exams, especially when it comes to be autorized to practice a profession. there is a reason you need to prove you can actually do it. sounds like a you problem. who tf will do this? you can afford college but not a printer? lmao womp womp. cry about it dork i confess it\\'s not one person.  maybe one got caught, but it\\'s not one person.  you can stop blaming the one person now. could somone link a source that says u of t will have accesses to hard drives? i honestly don’t think that’s true sounds like an issue with your school; kind of strange to project it to uoft the whole education system is brain-dead. just get peeps in make them write with a pen and paper. if they cant write they don\\'t deserve an education. literally fake it till you make it i guess getting used to printing and handwriting in binders if you want to be a litigator do students not understand the consequences of cheating? i wonder if this is gonna be the calculator debate of the future. “you aren’t going to be carrying a calculator around in your pocket all the time.” aged like milk. after spending 6 months in jail because of a terrible lawyer, i think a monkey holding an alexa would have been better representation. so, atleast ai will improve the worse of situations. \\nwhen your lawyer has a cocaine nose twitch and you wonder if he\\'s actually the prosecutor, atleast you can rest assured that he might be comfortable with the use of his ai assistant. 😀👍 well, a large percentage of college students don\\'t speak english at all so i\\'d expect it if i were a professor. all the indian girls did it on my wife\\'s course. it was pretty fucking pathetic they let them get away with it. i\\'m not talking law school here, however. what a shame small price to pay to ensure that morons aren\\'t getting a freebie in law school by using chatgpt. get over it not exactly ai but this feels relevant, i took an uber once and the guy was telling me about how he used to cheat so much that even when he got his masters he didn’t know anything about his field so now he’s stuck as an uber driver welcome to the real world.\\n\\nevery workplace i’ve ever been in has and will continue to have a handful of idiots who do something incredibly stupid that makes life harder for everyone else…forever. interesting my university basically has an open use policy on ai at the instructors discretion, and all of my classes give us free reign to use it but not on exams and if we get caught then it’s an academic penalty and treated the same as cheating. is this an urban myth or was it a bunch of ontario students who graduated with economics degree that all declared bankruptcy and that’s why we can’t get rid of our student loans very easily that way anymore so, your mad that them cheating is making it harder for you to cheat? imagine these monkeys end up being your lawyers… sorry i don\\'t think ai should be allowed in school period 😂 you\\'re graduating and let into the real world without doing 90% of the studying and work yourself? no. its not their fault the system is a farce and over half what your taught in exchange for that money is nonsense and useless. op honestly thinks that this one person is at fault? like somehow educators haven\\'t \\'caught on\\' to ai doing student\\'s work and will put policies in place to limit/remove use? \\n\\nsounds to me like  anyone that thinks that is smart enough to be a lawyer in the first place. was it an international student? the problem isnt that he used ai its that he was dumb enough to get caught. what a loser imagine being so dumb that you need ai for a law exam lol the lack of comprehension in this thread is outstanding. i feel bad for you man, sorry about that pretty that\\'s a violation of privacy. id fight that what do you mean print everything?\\xa0 boohoo you have to do something that helps maintain the integrity of everyones education. this was only a matter of time and was always going to happen, don’t act surprised. i’m confused did this happen at uoft or uofa where op goes?? how does your hard drive access prevent plagiarism. i\\'m trying to understand their logic it actually wasn’t a uoft law student. it was an undergraduate student at uoft. the law school heard of this and cracked down on us as a response. source: current uoft law student and this was the statement given to us by the assistant dean are there any university staff members you’re friendly with? they might be willing to print your stuff for you. you wouldn\\'t believe just how fucking stupid some college kids are. just had a test a few weeks ago where 12 people came in late and then got caught cheating by talking and sharing answers amongst each other. best part is we were allowed to bring our own cheat sheets for the test! it\\'s actually embarrassing that i have to be in the same classroom as these dumbasses. oh wait, i don\\'t, because they never come to class unless it\\'s for a test... 🙄 valid reaction tbh.. [removed] i had a lawyer tell me that ai will replace lawyers. he cheated by consulting with a lawyer from the future.  if he consulted with a lawyer from the past by phone it would be mentorship. lol karen better call saul so business as usual? “hold on your honour, i have to consult an expert in the field. *types into chat gpt* lol there are people already doing that in the workforce. i have seen it, it was not in the law department. while i do not have any issue with people using ai as a tool, i find it odd when people use it, take all the credit and are smug about \"accomplishing\" the task. wait until people starts representing themselves using ai as lawyers i actually have worked with 3 companies who are building ai for law offices specifically for research etc tools. they should embrace parts of it tbh because in the real\\nworld it will be used. now being able to take that and comprehend it is another skill entirely but it’s not going away and ignoring its benefits will set people behind. there are already plenty of cases of lazy lawyers having chatgpt write their briefs for them, or police who get search warrants based on free facial recognition sites - and the fallout is amazing. at that point, why even need a lawyer to begin with. ai can do it all. all lawyers will need to know how to use ai soon. if someone has been using ai for years during school, i think it gives them a leg up on the competition. didn\\'t people say the same thing about calculators? and now we\\'re allowed to use them for exams [removed] ai is the future of law. every case, every opinion, combed through to craft an opinion and shaped to match the biases of the judge.  lawyers will go the way of floor traders on an exchange i just want the tea on who the dumb mfer was that used ai for his law school exams. i think they are making it so students can’t access their hard drives during tests. it\\'s angry_toast789 🥪 that one typo completely changed the meaning of your sentence. i was very confused for a minute lol imagine getting a math degree but using a calculator to do your homework\\n\\nimagine getting a cs degree and relying on an ide  what do americans call “college”. community college? it’s quite common, actually. for example - “university of saskatchewan college of law”. we refer to the actual institution as the university (so we are “university” students) however each individual department is referred to as “college of x.” i don’t think every university in canada is structured this way, but some certainly are. using the term college definitely doesn’t make you a bot or an american 🤣 you know, i think op is a bot account. i\\'m downvoting the thread. it depends on what i\\'m talking about. if i\\'m talking about the larger institute or just in generalizations i attended it\\'s uni, if i\\'m talking about the specifics i\\'ll talk about the college or department that i was a student of. the name of my school starts with college so i say it lol university of guelph:\\n\\nontario agriculture college \\n\\nontario veterinary college \\n\\ncollege of biological sciences \\n\\netc. i am canadian and i\\'m getting a bachelor\\'s degree at a college instead of a university, my college offers like 8 different bachelor\\'s programs. so i say \"college\". and i mean \"college\", not university. because the name of my school says \"college\" in it. it mostly has diploma and certificate programs. one thing you learn when you go to a  canadian college or university is that they let people from all over the world attend.  \\n\\nyou can also move to canada from other places at any point in your life.\\n\\nstrangely, they don\\'t make you canadianize your vocabulary at all. [https://law.usask.ca/index.php](https://law.usask.ca/index.php) \\\\- see link. uhh, canada has colleges. i attended algonquin college. lmao. i think the op must be ai. great catch. they not like us lots of people. are you from ontario or something? lol every canadian.\\n\\nhttps://www.ucanwest.ca/blog/education-careers-tips/what-is-the-difference-between-colleges-and-universities-in-canada international students exist?? it will make up fake sources though. if you know how to prompt and proofread you can use it to speed up your writing quite a bit. ayyy gottem the best will be when it recommends a long list of useful cases with nice summaries and then the actual cases do not exist when someone checks. haha good one. lawyers love paper. at least they did in 2013. surprised these law students dont have enough critical thought yet to send a letter to the dean and rectify this cause obviously the school is way past its bounds now, students dont have to put up with this just cause the school is late on technology. that’s an american thing. canadians don\\'t, non-canadians attending them often do. which is the worst issue you can have in fucking law school. literally, boo fucking hoo, you\\'re in law school lol. it was an undergrad, not a law student theres a difference between effort and time actually spent learning. lets just say memorization, which is the bulk of work for early law students, isn\\'t exactly productive work that creates any other direct value than what they learn and think through learning it, and the amount of effort is non-linear to the results. if you can get to the same result on a shorter path, why take the long way home? maybe they can’t afford college? very helpful comment, ten out of ten helpfulness. just kidding. you reek. no check out examsoft info - that is the program that is used. it offers “secure” and “non-secure” options. in non-secure mode, internet is disabled but student have access to their computer hard drives. this allows for us to access our notes without having to print them off. however, this student found a way to import ai software into his hard drive, allowing access to the ai during the exam even though internet was disabled. can definitely confirm that it is fairly common for law students to be permitted access to their hard drives as exams tend to all be open book and this saves printing costs as well as the environmental costs associated with printing notes. they didn’t. read better. i work at a school and they do not 😬 *free reign *cheaters should be banned*\\n\\n*for life from whatever it*\\n\\n*was they cheated in*\\n\\n\\\\- mapleskid\\n\\n---\\n\\n^(i detect haikus. and sometimes, successfully.) ^[learn&#32;more&#32;about&#32;me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/haikusbot/)\\n\\n^(opt out of replies: \"haikusbot opt out\" | delete my comment: \"haikusbot delete\") the strongest steel man is that it will replace all of lawyers work, but lawyers will still have to sign off on things for insurance purposes nah he cheated by getting someone to do his work for him.\\n\\nif he just got someone to help him with his work it would be tutoring. he was actually a very good lawyer i see this as i’m watching the show it would technically be better to text them, giving them room to ask the ai before responding to you bitter call saul is more like it. wouldn\\'t worry to much if they can use ai to accomplish work assignments and get away with it won\\'t be very long till they get replaced by ai. if i was them i\\'d be more worried than smug. my sister is in academics, indigenous studies, and her department is planning to have a meeting about how they can use ai - she\\'s gonna raise a huge stink about it, how bad it is for the environment (water is life, after all) and how damaging ai will be to the future of independent and critical thought. i was so disgusted to find out some of her colleagues are embracing ai, like.... this is supposed to be a university and you\\'re promoting this shit???? do you tell your workplace that microsoft excel calculated the average rather than you? there’s no way this isn’t already happening. why pay for a lawyer when you have chatgpt! /s \\n\\ni’m more concerned about the decision-makers who will use it, though, particularly if they don’t disclose that to the parties. too many people who should know better have very little appreciation for the specific risks of ai and the law. i’m a doctor and google things with the patient in the room. i don’t know everything. until google can write legal prescriptions and take on all the liability i will have a job. for context, i’m using college as in “the college of law at the university of alberta” it’s funny because everyone will be using ai for all their jobs soon, just like we all use calculators and computers. knowing how to use the technology properly will be the same as boomers not knowing how to attach files to emails. uh huh? 😂 that’s a nice link you got there i love the internet. im gonna guess that’s\\xa0\\n\\na- a rickroll\\n\\nb- a scene from htf\\n\\nor\\n\\nc- some weird shit rickrolled in 2025 :( that\\'s a lot of legalese bullshit. damn 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 i got got youtube ads really ruin a good rickroll. dammit you got me!! you\\'ve bested me on this sunday morning. rickolas & rollerston attorneys at law llp lol 😂 probably so they can\\'t get banned this is kind of a silly comparison. i agree that you can use ai productively to help you improve your work output and quality, but people here are clearly talking about having ai write entire papers for them. this is more like getting a math degree by getting your math tutor to do your homework canada university = america college\\n\\ncanada college = america community college university (bachelor\\'s). see harvard college. wait why? i think you\\'re a bot and i\\'m downvoting your comment. so, what, one couldn\\'t have grown up in the states and sometimes say college too when referring to university without being a bot? maybe you\\'re the bot. what would be the point of a bot pushing this agenda lol\\n\\nsome spooky organization doesn’t want dumb kids to cheat on uni exams? ok sure, but i\\'m pretty certain only a small minority of schools in canada including u of t have a college system. it\\'s normal to say department or faculty, those terms are used everywhere. if you take ai output without verifying and correcting it, you deserve fake sources in your paper. oh i know i meant with actual sources online, not asking it for sources xd kinda like how hiring a tutor can improve your writing quite a bit but hiring a tutor to write your entire project for you will get you in trouble when i was in law school, students who opted to hand write had higher averages. that was 10 years ago. if you prepared properly, you aren’t using control f all that much because you know the material well enough to not need it (or you know where it is). i want to clarify at what point the use of ai becomes unethical. i really wonder what would happen if a school caught a student using ai to reference and quickly overview a topic or ask specific details, and then use that to help them with their papers. now we can even search the web for sources, and deepseek is very reliable with sources. but yes any student getting caught ctrl c ctrl p from chatgpt for a whole text deserves it, but not at the cost of these other students education. what? why are you afraid of thinking haha. just use ur brain silly, you don’t need ai to be faster! keep crying dork😢😢 that makes sense for now, but what happens when ai becomes reliable enough that even the insurance companies trust it without human oversight? but it\\'s not a someone.\\xa0 it\\'s the tool that every lawyer will use or be replaced by.\\xa0 using a calculator in school was cheating and forbidden at first.\\xa0 the next generation was mandated to buy and use them. yes, exactly, you should call him in a world full of chucks and howards, you want a saul. there\\'s no future in law. good, or ethical? indigenous studies, a department concerned with preserving the culture and traditions of a people who themselves have often been alienated from it in modern times, want to use a technology that\\'s famously known for just wholesale making shit up? i can\\'t see any way this can possibly go wrong.\\n\\nfor real tho just get her to talk about how often ai \"hallucinates\" and adds completely wrong info in ways that seem legitimate to outside observers, hopefully that should shut that shit down. eh. ai is a tool. it has legitimate and useful uses in every field as well as stupid and damaging uses.\\n\\nalthough you are very right about the environmental implications. how do you think the academic conversation went surrounding the internet from 92-99?\\n\\nultimately it was embraced, because it\\'s here now and it\\'s more efficient. that doesn\\'t take away from the responsibility to ensure academic integrity, but it\\'s a tool that\\'s not going away.\\n\\nit\\'s time to learn and teach proper use, not pretend it doesn\\'t exist. genuine question. how is ai bad for the environment? huh? everyone should be embracing a tool that makes you more efficient. or choose to be at a disadvantage to everyone else who will. treat ai just like something you read on the internet, use judgment and dont just blindly one shot it. i think you missed the point... i think it’d be fair to question the wording, obviously they targeted the last part (which doesn’t inherently mean they ignored your point), because many things are “accomplished” using tools. it is 100% already happening. in some cases with hilariously bad results for the person using it, but tons of self reps are already relying on ai. uofa has a law faculty… not a college stupid bot for a lot of people using ai takes the soul out of what they do. it’s not the same as not wanting to learn email imo while i actually agree to a fair extent, if someone actually gets *caught*, then they almost certainly *weren’t* using it properly. it’s extremely useful for editing and can help with writers block, but overall it’s pretty trash at creating original content. ai is notoriously wrong so much of the time that it\\'s not the same as learning a routine functionality like the use of a calculator. htf? probably 1.59b if it’s not regarded it’s redacted is the university of michigan a university or college? my understanding is that in the u.s college is used colloquially for post secondary but actual terminology is:\\n\\ncommunity college: 2-4 year associates degrees, diplomas, certificates and other training. some courses can be transferred over to a 4 year bachelors at another institution so people can have a blended education at community college + college/university.\\n\\noften programs offered but not always, are more vocational and polytechnic . again some more theory/traditional academic courses offered with transference to other institutions\\xa0\\n\\ncollege: institution that exclusively provides undergraduate 4 year bachelor’s education, there are no grad programs for masters or phds at these places.\\n\\nuniversity: offers bachelor’s undergrad and postgrad masters/phd programs\\n\\n\\ni think in canada most if not all places that offer undergrad bachelors also have grad programs so they are all universities by definition. i don’t know of any undergrad exclusive “colleges”\\n\\n\\nwe call community colleges - “college”. same concept and can also be blended or jointly partnered with universities\\xa0 i’m even more confused now. i’ve lived in canada all my life and university always meant 4~ year bachelors and college meant 2~ year diploma. i think your a bot and im downvoting your reply i\\'m not using it at all, personally just trying to point out its flaws to people who are. exactly i\\'m agreeing with the comment i\\'m replying to. ie: the ability to learn, and learn well, is a skill in itself. you have to learn, to learn efficiently. \\n\\nso it’s a skill issue. duh. no i mean insurance generally, not insurance companies. basically, when you have a lawyer draft a contract for you, you’re entitled to rely on the fact that the contract gives you the rights that the lawyer says it does. if you get sued and it turns out the contract doesn’t actually give you those rights, you can go after your lawyer to be made whole. especially if you need a criminal lawyer. why not if sol goodman represents you you may have reason for a mistrial now that\\'s a quote. chuck was a better lawyer though chuck and howard were perfectly competent lawyers.  chuck just screwed up *one address*. one of her students used ai to create an image for some kind of project she assigned and the image was all just stereotypical tropes and it looked borderline racist lmao. she\\'s pushing back as hard as she can, unfortunately the meeting about it hasn\\'t happened yet hard disagree, ai has no place in the humanities as practiced in academics. ai might have a place, but it\\'s not in institutions whose entire purpose is to teach independent and critical thought, especially when that thought is focused on the culture of water protectors. ai requires a lot of processing power -> requires huge centers with hundreds of computers all running simultaneously -> produces lots of heat -> uses absurd amounts of water/electricity while emitting greenhouse gases (not to mention the increased demand of resources makes your bills more expensive) every ai search consumes 500 ml water that can\\'t be properly recycled to drinking water because the datacenters themselves do not treat/use the same water. besides that the datacenters are in fact refusing to enter into talks with the local municipalities to buy electricity in bulk so that the municipality can plan for the people that actually live there. there\\'s nothing to be missed damn, i was going to give op the benefit of a doubt and assume they were american. \\n\\ni don’t want to say the word bot just yet but i’ve got my pitchfork ready just in case. [https://law.usask.ca/index.php](https://law.usask.ca/index.php) \\\\- normal to use college as well. lmao it actually frees up mental power to go deeper into the soul? it allows your brain which isn’t very good at processing large datasets to be able to boil that info down and for you to make more insights from these pieces of info. you just don’t understand it and that’s ok it’s new, but you will have to soon. i mean it’s useful for processing and providing insights from large datasets. which we aren’t great at. not writers block lmao. even in this early stage of ai which will quickly shift to something that you will have to use. if you can’t see it yet that’s cool, but make no mistake that’s where it’s heading. happy tree friend, its an adult cartoon with a lot of gore i love that i came here after the correction yet i knew what the typo was immediately it is a university, as the name suggests. however, it would be colloquially referred to as a university only in canada, and would be referred to as a college in the us. as someone who grew up in the us: it wouldn’t be unusual to say “i went to college at university of michigan.” even ivy league schools like dartmouth in the us are literally named “dartmouth college”. my comment exclusively pertained to how these schools are referred to colloquially. yeah same. but in the us college means 4 year bachelors. i went to canadian college for 4 year bachelor\\xa0 don\\'t unis have colleges within? like uoft having trinity and st. michael colleges fair. oh i didn’t mean it in a targeted way, it was hypothetical if your not using it you\\'re behind the curve and everyone who is using it will get ahead of you better memory retention. www.learningscientists.org/blog/2024/7/18-1%3fformat=amp interesting perspective. so does that mean the real reason ai won’t replace lawyers completely isn’t about capability, but about accountability? is he a *criminal* lawyer tho? saul broke chuck with his superior shyster skills i am not crazy! i am not crazy! i know he swapped those numbers! i knew it was 1216. one after magna carta. as if i could ever make such a mistake. never. never! i just – i just couldn\\'t prove it. he – he covered his tracks, he got that idiot at the copy shop to lie for him. you think this is something? you think this is bad? this? this chicanery? he\\'s done worse. that billboard! are you telling me that a man just happens to fall like that? no! he orchestrated it! jimmy! he defecated through a sunroof! and i saved him! and i shouldn\\'t have. i took him into my own firm! what was i thinking? he\\'ll never change. he\\'ll never change! ever since he was 9, always the same! couldn\\'t keep his hands out of the cash drawer! but not our jimmy! couldn\\'t be precious jimmy! stealing them blind! and he gets to be a lawyer!? what a sick joke! i should\\'ve stopped him when i had the chance! and you – you have to stop him! you- oh no, not electricity usage! guess we better shut down hospitals, stop running the internet, and go back to carrier pigeons. while we\\'re at it, let\\'s ban video games, netflix, and literally every data center because, you know, they also use power. or maybe, just maybe, we can acknowledge that technological progress has always required energy, and instead of pearl-clutching, focus on making it more efficient. then don\\'t do anything digital for entertainment\\n\\nno reddit, no netflix, no league\\n\\nat least people use ai for work and productivity multiple companies are involved in ai tech, can you name the company that is performing these actions? don\\'t they just recirculate the water? this is false and total bullshit.  aside from actual research on this topic, water never disappears, it changes form only to eventually return.  it\\'s a ridiculously stupid argument to push. how much water does a google search use ( \\ngoogle processes about\\xa08.5 billion\\xa0searches every day, which is roughly 99,000 searches per second.\\xa0this translates to about 2 trillion searches annually.\\xa0https://quickshare.samsungcloud.com/jcjutdc4runa )\\n\\nif you find ai stupid, you are cognitively impaired.  garbage in, garbage out. then don\\'t do anything digital for entertainment\\n\\nno reddit, no netflix, no league\\n\\nat least people use ai for work and productivity notably not in alberta. as someone who’s job is working with ai, i agree. ai is good for a lot of things, but it is not magic, it ain’t doing anything that requires soul. you’re fighting ghosts here buddy. i never said there’s anything inherently wrong with ai, just that using an llm to write your coursework is not the right time or place for them. \\n\\nyou’re there to learn, not produce vague, low to mid tier essays. especially someone in law school—people are gonna get thrown in jail if lawyers start relying on chatgpt to argue their cases. ah right forgot about that lol\\n\\ngood times watching that in middle school lmfao they also have something called an associates degree, but i am not sure what that is either yep although your degree will be under written by a university ex constoga collage with mcmaster for nursing. however an advanced deploma (3 year) dosen\\'t require an university. thise credits mostly transfers to a university however minimum 1.5 year to get a degree. + acceptance. yes. lawyers are professional scapegoats, among other things howard: *pikachu face* you can’t compare those things to ai.\\xa0 https://archive.is/y6owg link to washington post article from november 1, 2024 the thing in talking about specifically is about halfway through and happening in ohio. ai will be the legal system in the not so distant future. but yeah myb, i get what you’re saying yeah, happy cake day btw we have associates, which are common at canadian colleges. they’re 2 year degrees, and credits can often can be transferred to bachelor programs at a university. i\\'m sorry, i\\'m not sure i understand you.\\xa0 that’s an interesting way to put it. do you think that’s the primary function of lawyers, or just an unavoidable side effect of the job? microsoft is having a nuclear power plant on 3 mile island recommissioned to run its ai. thanks! don’t even notice lol https://nursing.mcmaster.ca/alteration-coming-in-mcmaster-mohawk-conestoga-bscn-program-2/\\n\\n\\ni guess things are changing a bit, i guess it is also possible for a college to be a university, kinda like ocad university where the c stands for collage. there are lots of types of lawyers with varying functions, so it’s hard to say what the “primary” function of lawyers is. i don’t think i’m cynical enough to say being a scapegoat is the primary function either, but maybe check in with me after a few more years of practice lol.\\n\\ni’d say it’s unavoidable though. i mean the whole reason you hire a lawyer is because you don’t know very much and they’re supposed to be experts on protecting your interest. they’re not much use if you can’t rely on them, and the right to rely is ultimately enforced through suing if they end up leading you astray. it’s one reason why every practicing lawyer carries insurance.\\n\\nit’s the same thing with doctors. you’re not supposed to know much about health compared to them, so you go to them for medical advice and you’re entitled to rely on the fact that their advice is correct. if they give you the wrong advice/treatment and you are harmed because of that, you are entitled to sue. some colleges (that are now often called \"polytechnics\") are allowed to issue bachelor degrees without being affiliated with university.\\xa0 it\\'s funny as that is a older name being reused but it\\'s good that there are more options for degrees now. it\\'s funny to see all the schools i knew that have renamed them selves. regardless thanks for the new info.\\n\\n\\nit\\'s hard to find concrete information on this/what schools can do degree programs and how. senica has a small blurb on there wikipidia page where a % of programs are allowed to ve but that seems outdated.\\n\\n\\ni definitely didn\\'t mind spending the cheeper collage fees when i went.'"
